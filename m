I was going to pick the patch up and modify it, but I think you managed
to send it out as an html email so it didn't reach the mailing list archive=
s.
If you could send a v2 with s64 buf[2]; that would be great.
Due to some travel I need to send a pull request shortly but this won't be =
in
a release for some time (as pull is targetting 6.6) so not a problem as long
as we make sure to address in soon.

Thanks,

Jonathan
