Does it mean the next read is going to fail?  I'm too lazy to look at
datasheet to see what you mean by FIFO access sequence.
If it does I'd rather we reported error as early as possible.

Mind you I can't remember if errors in here result in anything useful anyway.

Hmm.  Usually the warn splat works out as enough to provide
a hint. Kind of depends on whether the particular failure blocks correct
handling or not.  Some devices don't care if you successfully
read the buffer or not.  Its always annoyed me that there is no
IRQ_ERROR return.

We mostly try to enable as many userspace paths as possible.  If they
ask for something and we can easily do it (even if it stops something
else) then we are fine with it.

I agree, but doesn't mean we aren't nice to them anyway :)  Expectation
is they should go back to a sensible state before setting up something new
and complex.


Now if it's tricky to handle in code then we can indeed use an error.

I have better understood how you are are handing fifo vs data ready
now hence I'm not that bothered by this spitting out an error.  It's the same
as changing a trigger when a buffer is running which makes little sense,
though it only applies in INDIO_BUFFER_TRIGGERED mode.
Perhaps we should broaden that and then we'll block much earlier.

Its not a level IRQ?  What fun. Indeed silly corner case.

Oops. I'm wrong in this.  I'd forgotten the distinction between
INDIO_BUFFER_TRIGGERED and INDIO_BUFFER_SOFTWARE.

You should set this as you have done.

I don't mind having it - I'd just like a little comment including what
minimum sleep time is and that a VDD supply enable may add time to it.

So set the bounds.
