Hi Lars,

The way this is supposed to work is that each element is aligned to its
own natural alignment. What seems to be missing at the moment is that
the total length is also aligned to the size of the first element, so
that alignment is preserved for multiple consecutive samples. I feel
like we had that at some point, but maybe I'm misremembering.

E.g. putting something like

 unsigned int first_index = find_first_bit(mask, indio_dev->masklength);
 length = iio_storage_bytes_for_si(indio_dev, first_index);
 bytes = ALIGN(bytes, length);

below the loop should do the trick I believe.
