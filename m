Hello Jonathan,

Sorry for the delayed response.

If you don't mind, I can prepare such a patch.

I think it's a good idea. I didn't think about the configs when runtime pm
is disabled. So looks like we need to make sure that device is workable
from a pm perspective, and it is achievable only using a direct
msa311_set_pwr_mode() call as you suggested below.
