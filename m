It's worse than that - it would need be defined so userspace running
against the devices with the special channels would have to work without
knowing anything about them. So we couldn't do the really nasty thing
of setting scan_index the same for both of them with same storage size and
different shifts and real_bits.  That would be the sort of things that might
crash userspace code.

Driver effects are less of an issue than ABI breakage - or even just
ABI a userspace author would not expect.

Indeed - I get the concept, but don't like it.=20
In general it's a dead end for general purpose channels - because of that
pile of legacy userspace.  It 'might' just about be acceptable for 'meta da=
ta' channels
or where we are adding significant new interface for functionality purposes=
 (e.g.
when we did the newer DMA buffer stuff).

 Only on the

Yeah.  The channel group thing was for normal naturally aligned packing, not
data backed tighter than that.

*looks doubtful*  Maybe I can be convinced.  We'll see.
