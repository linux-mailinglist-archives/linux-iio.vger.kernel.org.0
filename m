Excellent.  Great work btw - this looks really nice now.

I did a final scan through (most of the code was familiar for some reason :)
I've called out a few things that I'd like to see tidied up in follow up patches
but definitely nothing that prevents us making the move out of staging.

If you are happy to do a patch dropping of_match_ptr() then great, if not I'll
send one out at somepoint soon.  I didn't want to just sneak it in here as an
edit whilst applying because I like the clean copy of identical code in these
move patches.

If anyone else wants to review, unless they see anything critical / ABI changing
I'd like any follow on work that comes up to be done as patches on a normal / non
staging driver.

Removing another directory in staging/iio is great as well :)

Applied to the togreg branch of iio.git, but pushed out initially as testing to
let 0-day take a quick look.

Thanks

Jonathan

Nice to tidy up:
This is a pet hate of mine.   Why have a define for DRV_NAME that is only
used in one or two places?  That's where we will go to find out what it is
called, so define just makes that take one more step!

Potential issue in long term but wait and see:
Hmm. The about equal makes me a little nervous long term.  Far too much history of
parts being produced that don't quite meet the documented timing.  Still can fix
it if we see any problems.

Fix this in a follow up patch:

Don't guard a of_match_table with of_match_ptr().  All that does is prevent
any chance of using another firmware (ACPI PRP0001 for example) that
uses this table to match.
