Very much not!  We need to present same data alignment to userspace
indpendent of what architecture is running. 

It's annoyingly inconsistent how 8 byte elements are handled on 32 bit
architectures as some have optimized aligned access routines and others
will read as 2 32 bit fields.  Hence we just stick to 8 byte value is
8 byte aligned which is always fine but wastes a bit of space on x86 32
bit - which I don't care about ;)

Please drop this last bit of the comment as we should just say what it
does, not conjecture what it might do!
