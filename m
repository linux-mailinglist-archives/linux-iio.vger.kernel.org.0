Since you still haven't got a point the conclusions are wrong.
The point is (I dunno how more clear to make it) is to have proper
layering from the (current) design perspective.

If we go to the road full of "if it will come XYZ then this sucks".
The future is uncertain and neither of us may prove the current
change good or bad in terms of the future (unknown and uncertain)
changes.

Preventing this patch to land is to tell "Oh, my design is bad,
but I will keep it, because in the future everything may change".
So, why don't you make this future to be now?

Really. arguments about the future changes are weak. If you have
patches in mind, send them, We will see in practice what you meant.

The problem here is that every driver would like to do this differently
and since it's related to the calculation we will have all possible error
prone implementations which do miscalculations (yes, one may not notice
traditional off-by-one until it becomes a huge issue by using additional
conversion formulas or so).

I'm very well fine with that. As I mentioned from the beginning, I may rebase
this on top of the Liam's work.
