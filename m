Drivers almost always support a subset of functionality of the device.
This isn't much different.  The driver 'should' use interrupt-names
but it doesn't need to support all the things that the binding says should
be in there.

Sometimes we document things in a driver, but there isn't any obligation to
do so and those docs are often out of date.

How do you establish the offset to apply to single ended channels if you do=
n't
know the value of REF- (relative to local ground)?

So no - as the device supports single ended channels the difference isn't
enough information.  It would probably be fine to do as you say if it
were a device with only differential channels where all that matters is
the scaling.

Yes - it is fine for a driver to only support a subset of functionality
and fail to probe if that subset isn't what the hardware enables.

Yes.
