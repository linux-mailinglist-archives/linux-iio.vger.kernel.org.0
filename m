Thanks for reviewing the patch and provide feed back.

When a label is explicitly configured means that the userspace expects 
to have that value available. Therefore, I don't see this as ABI change, 
given that this affects the property label content and not for example 
the property name.

Not sure I understand this. If you could explain a bit more I would 
really appriciate.

The node name supposed to be unique AFAIK and you're right it is 
available already in the userspace.
My point with this patch is to provide a default value for the label 
content and I'm open to suggestions related to content. The of_node name 
was something that I thought that is unique and easy to use, but if 
somebody has better suggestions I'm really open to these.
