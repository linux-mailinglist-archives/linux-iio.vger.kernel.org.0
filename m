Fabrice,

Sorry for the delay, I'm currently working through my backlog. I see you
have already submitted a version 2 of this patchset, so I'll continue my
review there but I do want to make some direct replys here below as
well.

Typically the author of the initial patch will also maintain what they
are introducing, but an alternative person is acceptable to serve as
maintainer if that's the plan that's agreed upon. I assume you're
introducing this tool because you're using it internally at ST for
testing, so I suppose the intention is not to get this merged upstream
just to abandon it (i.e. you intend to keep using and improving it). Is
the plan for you to maintain this utility, or is someone else at ST
interested in it?

I was wrong in my previous reply. You're absolutely correct[^1] that
userspace ABI must be consistent ("Breaking user programs simply isn't
acceptable"[^2]) so the specific values must remain the same between
kernel versions.

Regardless, I don't think raw numbers provide much benefit for the
use-case of this particular utility; users are testing watch
configurations for a particular device, not the specific constant values
in the data structures. So in the end I still think the raw numbers
code path should be removed.

[^1] Well technically Linux kernel ABI README documentation file
     (Documentation/ABI/README) states that backwards compatibility for
     stable interfaces is only guaranteed for at least 2 years, but in
     practice we strive to never change the user-facing ABI.
