I'll probably be fine as I wouldn't expect the raspberry pi tree to
be carrying any changes in this area.  If there are minor issues I can
usually just fix them up whilst applying.

These potentiometer drivers tend to be very simple, (the ds1803 is
only 167 lines long so you may find that you'd end up adding more
code to make it flexible enough to take your new part than a
new driver would need.

So perhaps the question we should ask is if we are likely to see
support for a wide range of similar parts?  If we are then now
is a good time to make the driver more flexible.

Working that out will require some datasheet diving..
My guess is the ds3501 is pretty similar but with some extra bits.

Given these are fairly simple, your best route to an answer might
be to try adding it to the existing driver and see if you run
into any significant complexity.

It's not unheard of for us to merge drivers together in the future
once it becomes clear that we are supporting lots of similar ones
but it is easier done at the start!
