Alright, thank you for clarifying yours point! I helped Shreeya a tad
with preparing the v7 and disabling the regmap's lock wasn't under
question. Since this driver isn't about performance and a nanosecond
improvement isn't worthwhile in comparison to the the I2C transfer time,
should be cleaner to keep the regmap's lock in place, IMO. I'll let
Shreeya to answer next time, sorry for jumping in.
