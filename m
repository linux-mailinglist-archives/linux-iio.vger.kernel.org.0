Thanks for review! I'll address them for the next version. Some comments 
and discussion below.

You are right. I've overlooked this. Action is always both edges but 
what HW actually does here is an inversion control for each input signal 
so these should be then extensions I think.

 From the specification "An individually configurable Edge Select block 
allows control over rising or falling edge detection on each input pins, 
removing the need for platform logic inversion.".

Both are intented. Here pm_runtime_ calls are not only for accessing the 
registers like in other functions but keep the HW block on and be able 
to count when enabled. So after enabling the runtime PM usage count 
stays at least 1 and goes to zero only after disabling.

Good point. Will check how does it look.

Should this noise actually be visible as seconds (ns, Âµs, ms) instead of 
plain register value? From the spec "It selects the maximum glitch width 
to remove in terms of peripheral clock cycles: PCLK_CYCLES = MAX_COUNT + 2".

I think it should since for a person configuring the system plain 
register value is more or less guesswork.
