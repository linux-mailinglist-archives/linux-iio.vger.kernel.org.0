If you look at my .sig you might glean I probably know the odd thing or
two about filtersâ€¦ and 3dB frequency is just as meaningless without
knowing the filter type even before one enters into whether or not there
is peaking and resonance.

Donning my hat as a user: I beg to differ.  I know this device has 8
different settings for the tap length of some otherwise unspecified
filter (you can deduce that it must be a a recursive shift and
accumulate type thing) and more taps mean larger timeconstant / somewhat
better smoothing.  I really just want to chose among these eight
settings and not calculate a 3dB frequency that isn't in the datasheet
(and maybe even a different one depending on the four other three-bit
choices I have w.r.t. device settings).

I imagine the reason this particular device uses this attribute is
purely due to the fact that it was already available and corresponds
roughly to what the control does.

Filter settings: 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 (see datasheet, that's 2**i below)

That's the simplest I can think of, really.  Per the datasheet, the
actual filter is:

  y(t) = ( (y(t-1) << i) - y(t-1) + x(t) ) >> i
       = 2**-i * x(t) (2**i-1)*2**-i * y(t-1) )

The canonical recursive single-pole LP has two coefficients, which
should be 1-d and d (d because it's the sample decay).

   2**-i + (2**i-1)*2**-i = 2**-1 * ( 1 + 2**i - 1 ) = 1

so check that.  The time constant (rise time to 63%) is then

  tau = -1/ln(d)

Oddly enough the data sheet gives time to >75%, but that is just a
scaling factor of ln(0.25) on the tau.  The nomalized corner frequency then is:

  fc/fs = -ln(d)/(2pi)

So lets check that:

|---+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+----------|
| i |    1-d |      d |    tau |  t>75% | datasheet |    fc/fs |

Given that it says w_c and said angular frequency, I'd wager a guess
that there's a factor 2pi that needs to go.  Yep, close enough
numerically.  Next time I'm bored I will whip out the trigonometric
identities table in Bronstein/Semendjajew and see why that arccos
espression is the same as -ln(d).

I'd still rather specify the filter as integers than having to enter
those floating-point numbers to get the device set up.

Achim.
