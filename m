So... It turns out, I swapped schan and rescaler values which gives us:

numerator = 90
denominator = 1373754273
schan_val = 261
schan_val2 = 509

line
38: tmp = 261000000000   ; 261 * 1000000000
39: tmp = 189            ; 261000000000 / 1373754273
40: tmp = 17010          ; 189 * 90
42: rem = 17010          ; 17010 % 1000000000
    tmp = 0              ; 17010 / 1000000000
43: *val = 0
51: if (<fractional>) [yes]
52: tmp = 509
56: if (17010 > 10000000 && 0/509 < 100) [no && yes]
66: *val = 0
    *val2 = 509
    return <fractional> [0.000000000]

Swapping back the values, I get the same results as you!

Also, replacing line 56 from the snippet above with

	- if (abs(rem) > 10000000 && abs(div64_s64(*val, tmp)) < 100) {
	+ if (abs(rem)) {

Fixes these precision errors. It also prevents us from returning
different scales if we swap the two divisions (schan and rescaler
parameters).

I was only using 16-bits as an example, but I guess you're right, these
values do start to make sense when you're looking at 24-bit and 32-bit
ADCs.

Agreed, and looking at this more, there's still ways to improve without
having to compromise.
Hopefully adding the test suite will make it easier to catch potential
regressions in the future :-)

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. The point of switching to
IIO_VAL_INT_PLUS_NANO at the moment is to get more precision on small
values. Am I missing something?

My apologies, discard this last comment. I was suggesting to guaranty
less precision, but consistent over the full range. I don't believe
that's a viable option.

Thanks again for your time,
