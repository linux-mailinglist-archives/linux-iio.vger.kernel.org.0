Hi Jonathan,

There's something in IIO scan_masks / buffer demuxing that I don't quite 
understand. I noticed following things:

1) Strict available scan mask check seems to be in use only for 
INDIO_BUFFER_HARDWARE stuff.

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc2/source/drivers/iio/industrialio-buffer.c#L881

So, the:

 >>> +static const unsigned long bm1390_scan_masks[] = {
 >>> +    BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE) | BIT(BM1390_CHAN_TEMP), 0

is not exclusive for BM1390 as long as it is not setting the 
INDIO_BUFFER_HARDWARE.

My test seems to agree with the code:

// Only enable the temperature:
root@arm:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# echo 1 > 
scan_elements/in_temp_en

// Run the geneeric buffer without -a:
root@arm:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# /iio_generic_buffer -c 20 -N 
0 -t bm1390data-rdy-dev0
iio device number being used is 0
iio trigger number being used is 0
/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 bm1390data-rdy-dev0

In above case the temperature values and only the temperature values 
were shown. I must admit I did not spend enough time with the 
iio_generic_buffer.c or IIO demuxing code to really understand all the 
details (I got headache very quickly ;) ). I still believe the 
iio_generic_buffer expects to see only the enabled channel data in the 
buffer - so, it seems to me the kernel is also only adding the enabled 
channel data to the buffer. Also, judging the values, the demuxing is 
correctly extracting the temperature data from data the driver pushes here:

iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(idev, &data->buf, data->timestamp);

The bm1390 driver as sent in v2 does not do demuxing but always pushes 
whole chunk of data and trusts IIO to do demuxing.

2) I noticed the 'available_scan_masks' was marked as an optional field. 
So, I think that if there is no restrictions to which of the channels 
can be enabled, then we can omit setting it. This is what I tried.

It appears that when we do not populate the 'available_scan_masks' with the:
 >>> +static const unsigned long bm1390_scan_masks[] = {
 >>> +    BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE) | BIT(BM1390_CHAN_TEMP), 0

things change. When I tested enabling only temperature and ran the 
iio_generic_buffer -c 20 -N 0 -t bm1390data-rdy-dev0 - the reported 
values seemed completely random.

When I initialized the pressure data in driver:
data->buf.pressure = 1;
before doing the:
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(idev, &data->buf, data->timestamp);

I saw following:

root@arm:/# cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0
root@arm:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# echo 1 > 
scan_elements/in_temp_en
root@arm:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# /iio_generic_buffer -c 20 -N

8000.000000
8000.000000
root@arm:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# cat in_temp_scale
31.250000

If we calculate 8000/31.250000 we will get value 256. This looks like 
value '1' in BE16 format.

Based on this experimenting (and headache obtained from reading the 
demuxing code) - the IIO framework does not do channel demuxing if the 
'available_scan_masks' is not given? To me this was somewhat unexpected.

Finally, when the watermark IRQ is used, we can't omit reading the 
pressure data because clearing the WMI is done based on the pressure 
data in FIFO.

So, I would propose we do:

static const unsigned long bm1390_scan_masks[] = {
	BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE) | BIT(BM1390_CHAN_TEMP),
	BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE), 0

which better reflects what the hardware is capable of - and, unless I am 
missing something, also allows us to offload the buffer demuxing to the IIO.

Still, as mentioned in 1), the

 >>> +static const unsigned long bm1390_scan_masks[] = {
 >>> +    BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE) | BIT(BM1390_CHAN_TEMP), 0

does not seem to prevent enabling only the temperature channel - so in 
the driver buffer handler we still must unconditionally read the 
pressure data regardles the active_scan_mask.

After staring this for a while, I see no reason why we couldn't do as 
you suggested. Thanks! It really improves this :)
