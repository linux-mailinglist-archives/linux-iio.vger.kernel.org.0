Any time next week should be fine.  If it ends up later that's fine as well.
We have at least a few weeks until the 5.18 release and then if we were to land
this during the first few weeks of the next cycle that would be fine as well.
No one should be insane enough to not pick up at least the first few stable
releases of a new kernel!

Perfect :)

Thanks for sorting this out.
