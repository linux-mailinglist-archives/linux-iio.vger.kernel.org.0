Should probably be easy to test, especially the camera flash thermal
zone heats up *very* quickly when the flash is on, so should be trivial
to set the trip point down from 125degC to e.g. 45degC and see what
happens.

So I did this and... nothing happened.
I watched /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone34/temp climb above 45degC and
nothing happened.

I guess trip type being "passive" and no cooling-device makes it not do
anything.

  =3D=3D> /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone34/trip_point_0_hyst <=3D=3D
  1000
  =3D=3D> /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone34/trip_point_0_temp <=3D=3D
  45000
  =3D=3D> /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone34/trip_point_0_type <=3D=3D
  passive

From Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal-zones.yaml:

  - active   # enable active cooling e.g. fans
  - passive  # enable passive cooling e.g. throttling cpu
  - hot      # send notification to driver
  - critical # send notification to driver, trigger shutdown

So unless we want to just shut down the system (with "critical"), I
don't think thermal can't really do anything else right now, since e.g.
leds-qcom-flash.c driver doesn't have any cooling support to lower the
brightness or turn off the LED.

So.. in essence not much we can do right now.

But seems we also cannot remove this (kinda useless) trip since we need
at least one trip point in the dts if I read the bindings yaml
correctly.

For sure.. I spent a bit of time looking into the proprietary Qualcomm
thermal-daemon sources but didn't really see much interesting things
there for this platform, maybe some of this thermal handling is
somewhere else - or half of these thermal zones aren't even used with
Android.

So.. good to get the current patch upstream or not? :)
