I'd suggest adding some text to the cover letter to explain this so you
can hopefully avoid being asked on v3 :)

Also for cases like this that sit at the boundary we tend to also
cc the hwmon maintainers so they are aware.  It can help us to make more
consistent decisions on where a future device belongs.

I'm not against having this in IIO, but nice to work by consensus and
avoid anyone getting a surprise.
