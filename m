Yes, I could have done a better job explaining my reason for this fix.
It seemed like the simplest fix that could be easily backported to
stable kernels. And then we can look at removing the legacy field
completely in the future.

This sounds very much like the work I am doing on SPI Engine offload
support - having a trigger associated with a buffer. So maybe
something will come out of that. =C2=AF\_(=E3=83=84)_/=C2=AF
