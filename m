ah. The degraded bit bothered me.  That wording makes me thing no effort

If we get it for free or near free than all is good!.

So what is the effective difference?  My assumption was that single-ended
means reference to 0V in all cases.  Pseudo differential means reference
to an input that is common across multiple channels, but not necessarily 0V?

Indeed that doesn't work.  Problem in this discussion is I've normally forg=

We have done things like that for a few corner cases where we were really s=
tuck
but it is indeed nasty and hard to comprehend. Also so far they've been 'ou=
t'
channels I think which doesn't make sense here.

OK.  It would be easy enough to apply an offset to that, but it would
complicate the driver and could seem a little odd.

OK.  I'm somewhat convinced that this is enough of a pain to describe that
we should just rely on them having some other way to get that offset if they
are deliberately using it to shift the range. We can revisit if it ever
becomes a problem.

So, I think the conclusion is just don't represent AIN-COMM (or similar)
as an explicit voltage we can measure.

I sympathise! It's been an annoyingly busy kernel cycle in the day job. I w=
as hoping to
get back to you sooner so that more of this was fresh(ish) in my mind :(

My gut feeling is that this is a case for documentation / really detailed c=
over
letter for the next version to make sure we have come to at least a (mostly)
consistent conclusion.
