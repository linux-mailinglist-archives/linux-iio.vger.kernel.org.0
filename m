Nope. It's a correctness issue not a performance one (though you may get
advantages there as well)  You can get potential corruption of
other fields that end up in the same cacheline - so the aim is to make
sure that nothing that we might use concurrently is in that cacheline.

There was a good description of what is going on here in a talk Wolfram
gave a few years back when he was exploring how to avoid bounce buffers
in I2C https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DJDwaMClvV-s that includes links to=
 descriptions
of the fun that can happen.  The short description is that a DMA controller=
 is
allowed to grab the whole of a cacheline (typically 64 bytes, can be bigger)
in coherently from the host (basically takes a copy).  It can then merrily
do it's operations before finally copying it back to the actual memory.
The problem lies in that there may be other data in that cacheline that
is accessed at whilst the DMA controller was working on it's own prviate
copy.  Those changes will be wiped out.

Now you probably didn't see it because:
a) Many controllers don't do this - either they don't cache stale data, or
   are sufficiently coherent with CPU caches etc that any changes in this
   'near by' data are correctly handled.

b) It's really hard to hit the races anyway. I've only seen it once when
   debugging real systems, but people run into this occasionally on IIO
   drivers and it is really nasty to debug.

c) On arm64 at least in many cases the DMA core will bounce buffer anyway
   after some changes made a couple of years back.  Unfortunately that isn't
   true on all architectures yet (I think anyway) so we still need to be
   careful around this.

Note some architectures (x86 I think) never allowed this cacheline corrupti=
on
path in the first place so the DMA_MINALIGN value is 8 bytes (IIRC).

Coherency is hard (but fun if you have time, particularly the places where
it is allowed to break and how they are avoided :)
