In that case it should report a processed value to indicate that.
It's admittedly a bit of a corner case given it's not processed by
the kernel - there is an argument that this (more or less) only
happens when someone has processed a raw ADC count but in theory
that's not necessarily true.

There are a few examples of drivers passing through the register value
as processed in tree - normally when there
is a microprocessor doing some fusion of signals or similar.

Raw gets reported on it's own in a few other cases, such as when
there are no known units - that happens for things like light intensity,
proximity (which is often reflected light intensity).
For those I'm not sure the rescaler is useful.
