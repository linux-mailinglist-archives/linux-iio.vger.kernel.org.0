If they are both present it is absolutely fine to pick one in preference
to the other.

That's an implementation choice to do them all based on one interrupt
pin so absolutely fine to do that in the Linux driver, but the dt binding
should allow for other choices as there are sometimes efficiency gains
in doing so.

Hmm. We do have precedence for a single control e.g.
nxp,fxls8962af.yaml as drive-open-drain.  So perhaps just go with that
and if anyone is needs different values we can figure it out later.
pin control (which is where that binding item comes from) seems to have
examples doing much the same.  Sets of pins with a single drive-open-drain
entry.

Linus, any comments on this as you've dealt with far more similar cases
than me!
