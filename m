Agreed that SPI_READY is possible if an SPI controller uses GPIOs for
CS and that signal.  If not a GPIO for CS then the SPI_READY should
also be hardware managed.

I could potentially be adapted to this sort of case if conditions
like the CS being active before the ready is set is taking into account.

This is a bit like SPI in general - far too many things that could
be built and no particular standards for them.
