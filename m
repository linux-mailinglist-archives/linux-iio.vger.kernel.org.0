If there are very large numbers of options, common solution is to
move to dynamic assignment and channel nodes so DT specifies what is
wired.  In theory we then allow all combinations at the same time but
rely on common sense to restrict it.  I don't suggest channel nodes
for most drivers because it adds complexity and a few unwired channels
being exposed is rarely a problem (mostly people buy the right sized ADC).
For cases like this though it can reduce things to a manageable level.

Also little purpose in supporting 1-2 and 2-1 which can simplify things
somewhat. However that can also be left unconstrained on assumption
common sense will be exercised in the DT.
