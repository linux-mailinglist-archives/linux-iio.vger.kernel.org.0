Did he suggest putting it inside the function?

Again, you are too focused on "const", I'm talking about "static". The
above doesn't clear a bit regarding why you hide the global variable
inside a function. I don't see either Sebastian's clear point on this.

You may add a static variable inside each function in the same module
and name it "foo" and there will be no conflict, but when you read the
code your brain will be spoiled. This is simply _bad code practice_. I
don't know how else I can explain this to you.

Again, you missed my point. I'm talking about reading and analysing
the code. Otherwise (good) compiler should spill a lot of warnings in
case you have global vs. local naming collision.

Nope. The RO section might be very well flashed into ROM, so...

So, whom should we listen to here? Because bad code is bad code. And
this is code above.
