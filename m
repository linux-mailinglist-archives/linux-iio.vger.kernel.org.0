I missed it.  Review is never perfect (mine definitely aren't!)

Thinking more on the adxl367. We still have a window to  fix that as
the driver isn't yet in a release kernel.  Would you mind spinning a
patch to fix that one?  Even if we miss the rc cycle (it's a bit tight
timing wise) we can sneak it in as an early fix in stable without
significant risk of breaking anyone's userspace.

There might be other drivers that have that interpretation we can't
fix but if we can reduce the scope of the problem by changing the adxl367
that would be great.

We should also definitely improve the docs and perhaps add a note to say
that due to need to maintain ABI, a few drivers use scans * number of channels
rather than scans.

Oops.  I got confused.  Code is fine as it is.  Adding the define isn't going to make
it much clearer.
