Definitely not a modifier.  It's almost arguable that these are different
characteristics of the channel so I can live with the ABI perhaps, but
unless this is a very common thing I'm not sure I want to burn 2 chan info
bits for them. Note we are running very low on those anyway without changing
how those are handled.  We will need to tackle that anyway, but let's not
tie that to this driver.

I don't like the idea of adding core magic to spin multiple files from one
without more usecases.  So for now use extended attributes for these if
we go this way.

I think I still prefer the separate channels approach.  Note this is how
we deal with devices that are capable of either single ended or differential
operation.  The channel numbering is reflecting the wire in both cases.
However, I'm not sure we've ever made it clear the ABI would apply like this.
We may have devices that use this interface but expect it to not apply to
the differential case....
