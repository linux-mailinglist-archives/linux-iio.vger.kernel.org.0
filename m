Ok. I guess this sort of papers over it in a vague fashion and
avoids pointing out there that there is breakage in the one interrupt case
beyond a hint in the commit message.

Better than nothing but only a partial fix for the actual issue
(where that issue isn't a binding warning!)

Applied to the fixes-togreg branch of iio.git
