Synchronising capture across a number of devices is usual reason for
this.  It's not perfect, but particularly if you have a device
with a complex trigger that is not occurring on at an even 'tick' of
time, then in those cases there isn't really any other way of doing
it.  However that irq is unrelated to this driver.  This driver
sees a trigger which it then identifies as not being it's own and
from that fires the conversion and waits for a completion.
The EOC interrupt handler knows we are in this mode and calls
complete() rather than iio_poll_trigger()
