Again, it's ACPI so I don't care. If someone cares about using DT 
bindings in ACPI they can step up and help maintain them. It's not a DT 
vs. ACPI thing, but just that I can only maintain so much and have to 
draw the line somewhere.

So, is someone telling you to fix this?

There are millions if not billions of DT based devices using 
undocumented bindings. If those used "ltr,ltrf216a", I wouldn't accept 
it either.
