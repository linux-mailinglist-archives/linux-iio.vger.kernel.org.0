It must remain buildable at all times.  That can either be done by
duplicating everything, or by pushing through a patch that performs
all renames (maybe excluding bindings as we care less about that).
The all renames in single patch is a lot easier to review as can
see both sides of the change in a single patch.

Breaking that up into sets of renames will keep it manageable.
