Please don't.  Just take a guess at 6.1. That will probably be right
and it'll save me effort when applying :) If it's not right then
no harm done as I need to edit it anyway.

Yes, though no need to give much description of them.
There is a script that compares the ABI exposed on a given platform with
these files and warns if things are missing.  Right now it gives so many
warnings (outside of IIO) that it's more or less unusable but the end goal
is to get to the pointer where systems doing build and boot tests will general
warnings for undocumented ABI.
