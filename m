Note this is perfectly reasonable detail to have in a cover letter but I agree
with Nishanth that it is too much for the patch description. 

Given we have very little for counter so far this cycle, please +CC
gregkh@linuxfoundation.org on v2.  That way we can be lazy and ask him to
queue it up directly if that makes sense at the time.

For background to this, as of last cycle I split the IIO and counter
pull requests for the first time.

Thanks,

Jonathan
