I think the answer to this is which callback is set in the chip_data struct=
ure
defines which one of the calibration buffers is in use for that purpose.
The one used for everything else is defined by the code path, not an explic=
it
variable.

There might be some (I haven't looked) but lock protection is unnecessary as
_cal buffers used before we register the device so there is no concurrency =
yet.

yes.  That seems a good idea.

It's worth giving unions a name if you are using them such that you write v=
ia
one element and read via another (e.g. for type conversion) but where it's =
really
just a case of potential space saving like this, nice to use an anonymous u=
nion
and shorten all the lines accessing the elements.

Agreed. I was thinking the same thing.  Pulling out that conversion as a pr=
ecursor
nop cleanup will make all the subsequent changes more readable. Great!

I'm not particularly fussy about reverse xmas tree so wouldn't normally
advocate a cleanup patch just to reorder local variable definitions.
However, I think in this case it would be good to have such a precursor
patch so as to make the ordering more logical for the additions made
by the rest of the series.

Thanks,
