No, I'm afraid it isn't, for two reasons:

1. These counters are often used in environments, where glitches can and do
happen. So sometimes there are fake events. The only way to tell fake from
real pulses, is to filter them. Unfortunately you need the timestamps of each
event for that.

2. Another reason for having time-stamps is the case when the frequency is low
and one still requires fast accurate measurements. In that case timestamps
provide a way of accurately measuring period time.
