Thanks for letting me know. I think the best course of actions now is
to settle down with what I have sent and you then rebase your stuff and
sent out for review. I will help with reviewing and I'm glad to hear
that you are step ahead of me. I wasn't planning to chase the inkern.c
in the future (at least nearest future).

That said, it seems like fits the #3 from the above list you provided.
