Maybe we fall back on a comment that says something like.

"This is not the same as spi-3wire." :)

Whatever we end up with here, I'd like everyone to agree it's
obviously different enough from existing SPI bindings that there won't
be any confusion.

Agreed.  Let us kick that into the future.

OK.

I'm not sure if the standard SPI bindings have an option for
CS tied active?  If so we should reuse that bit of [psson;e/

That's one I think we only bother supporting when we actually see it.
For previous chained devices I don't think we've ever needed to do
it because they tend to be used for 'more of the same' rather than
measuring different things.  Supplies so far have always been wired
to single regulator (or single control anyway).

I think that is simplest route.

Seems reasonable. Thanks for the various explanations. This chip is just odd :)
