Hi Primoz,

I doubt anyone reviewed the comment closely enough to say if what it was
suggesting was sensible or not, so the fact it was listed as a todo
doesn't directly impact this discussion.

Ouch.  Let me try to dig into this. Is this effectively relaxing the
constraints? I guess because a value that is perhaps always biased one way
is considered within bounds if those acceptable bounds are wider because
of lower precision?

I was assuming it was the other way around and the device had fixed constra=
int
limits and you needed to take more samples due to higher noise. Seems the
opposite is true here and that worries me.

I'll definitely need input from NXP on this as a workaround and their
strong support to consider it.

I'd assume trade off between time and calibration precision, not the
sort of use I think you are describing.

Superficially I'm struggling to not see this as broken hardware that it
is out of expected tolerances in some fashion.  Maybe I misunderstood
the issue.
