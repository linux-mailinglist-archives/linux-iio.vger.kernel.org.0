Good question. The first reason is that a somewhat similar API was 
intented before[1], but refused upstream as it was kind of re-inventing 
the wheel.

The second reason, is that we want to be able to share buffers too, not 
with gpu/video but with the network (zctap) and in the future with USB 
(functionFS) too.

There is some dma_fence action in patch #10, which is enough for the 
userspace apps to use the API.

What "horribleness" are we talking about here? It doesn't look that 
scary to me, but I certainly don't have the complete picture.
