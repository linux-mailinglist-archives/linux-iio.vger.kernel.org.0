who and how should investigate this issue? Would putting a kprintf in the hrtimer callback be enough to check?


Just to make sure I understood correctly: is this a separate issue from the warning I receive or are those linked?

I was thinking of doing this too, but I don't know if adding a mutex to frequently invoked functions is going to introduce some timing problems and so I was waiting for some comments on that matter. If nothing bad is expected I can surely try it.

Since more and more handheld PCs are coming and provided many vendors such as asus tends to improve what they did built on previous generations I think a general solution would be desirable.

Plus there are handheld PCs that does not yet have a driver (bmi270) or are using an existing one and it would be very difficult to fix it in every of them as of now, in the future I fear it will become almost impossible or extremely time consuming as market expands.

Hello Jonathan and thank you kindly for you answer,

I am very interested in the iio ecosystem as in those aforementioned handheld PCs the gyroscope plays the role as a mouse so it's a pretty important input device.

I am writing to lkml not just as a single developer, but as part of a larger community in this matter: this means we will be able to test any solution and in more than just one hardware.

To answers your questions:
1) yes, we all will be very happy to
2) as I am very busy right now I might be unable to do that immediately, but I will surely do it if one general solution cannot be found or is impractical.

As of my limited knowledge the number of drivers now existing that are affected are 2, and the number of drivers that will be affected, once the driver is written, will be at least 3.

Thank you very much for your answer,
Denis
