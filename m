yup. That does the job.

Rate of Change.

Hmm. We don't get these very often so I couldn't remember what the docs said wrt
to units.  Seems it is rather vague which isn't great.
See Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio and grep for roc_

Mind you this is getting close to the adaptive thresholds where pretty much anything
goes :)

That would work.  Just somewhere anyone wondering why it doesn't do what they want
would find it.

This one isn't quite true as I read it.  Not sure how you would use the positive and negatives differently
though...

Could also (I think) do the in window interrupt as a falling magnitude. 
Those tend to be used as freefall detectors which is always fun to test :)

this was mostly me figuring out that there were separate upper and lower thresholds.
So the enable is DIR_EITHER but the values are not.
