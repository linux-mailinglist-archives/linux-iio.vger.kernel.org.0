Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: iio: Document "label" property
Date:   Tue, 21 Dec 2021 10:43:54 +0000

All iio devices can have a label, which will be carried on to userspace
as a sysfs attribute. This is useful when having several iio devices
that represent different instances of the same hardware, as the name
attribute would then not be enough to differentiate between them.
