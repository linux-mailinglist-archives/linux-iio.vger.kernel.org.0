OK, it was a suggestion.  Even I was not convinced that it was a good
suggestion :)

I have updated it to take into account most of the mentioned issues
(gotos, etc).

In my version, I move the call up to the original declaration site, when
that is safe to do.  A negative aspect is that the original call site may
have been preceeded by comments, which get removed.  It's hard to know
what should be done with comments, so that has to be addressed manually.
But if we can leave the call site where it is, the comments should
naturally stay there too.

There remains the problem of very long lines.  Coccinelle has some
heuristics for dealing with this, but they don't fit well with this case,
where something before the function name is already very long.

Anyway, I will send a new version later today to illustrate what can be
done.  No implication that the semantic patch should be sent off to Linus
for immediate application across the kernel.  This seems like something
that should be checked more carefully, especially since there is the
opportunity to fix bugs along the way (I saw one case with a missing
of_node_put on an error path).
