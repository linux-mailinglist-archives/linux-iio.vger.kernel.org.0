Hi Utkarsh,

Welcome to IIO.

If you want a practical immediate task to make sure you have flow
of submitting patches etc correct, one issue we've just started seeing
is that when we do

make W=1

we get some misleading reports like:

Gwendal figured out what was going on.  It's down to an incorrect marking of the
initial comment block (where copyright notice etc is ) as kernel doc
by prefixing it with /**

If you'd like to first fine one of those cases and send a patch fixing it that
would be great.  Once we've sanity checked that first one for process issues etc
you could then ensure there are no other instances in IIO.

No problem if not and you want something more substantial to start with.
This is just something that hit my inbox today that I'd otherwise clean up,
but seemed like a good task for anyone wanting to get started!

Thanks,

Jonathan
