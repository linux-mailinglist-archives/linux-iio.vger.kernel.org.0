Well, I wanted struct device_node * child, but then there wouldn't be the
macro argument that would give the variable name.  So perhaps even with
the comma it would look a little more like a declaration.

It does seem problematic to have eg two freestanding occurrences of child
that are not in the same scope, if there is a child in the iterator
argument list and a use elsewhere in the function.

OK, the semantic patch can be changed to do that.  It would have to be a
bit more complex or a bit more defensive, to be sure that no variables are
used between the declaration and the current call site.

So the point is that we now allow declarations at random places, and not
only at the top of a function?

Yes, this could be addressed by running the rule more than once.

Thanks for the feedback!
