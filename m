There are two different approaches for this kind of nested locking. One 
is to use mutex_lock_nested(). This works if there is a strict 
hierarchy. The I2C framework for example has a function to determine the 
position of a I2C mux in the hierarchy and uses that for locking. See 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c#L1151.

I'm not sure this directly translates to IIO since the 
consumers/producers don't have to be a in strict hierarchy.  And if it 
is a complex graph it can be difficult to figure out the right level for 
mutex_lock_nested().

The other method is to mark each mutex as its own class. lockdep does 
the lock checking based on the lock class and by default the same mutex 
of different instances is considered the same class to keep the resource 
requirements for the checker lower.

Regmap for example does this. See 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c#L795.

This could be a solution for IIO with the downside how the additional 
work for the checker. But as long as there are only a few IIO devices 
per system that should be OK. We could also only set the per device lock 
class if in kernel consumers are enabled.
