I'm not extremely concerned here at the moment, as power should be the
last thing to be turned off, after clocks and reset signals. As clocks
and GPIOs will still be controlled manually in the driver .remove()
function, it means that power will go last, which should be fine.
However, should a devm_clk_get_enable() or similar function be
implemented, we'll run into trouble. Supplying active high input signals
to a device that is not powered can lead to latch-up, which tends to
only manifest after a statistically significant number of occurrences of
the condition, and can slowly damage the hardware over time. This is a
real concern as it will typically not be caught during early
development. I think we would still be better off with requiring drivers
to manually handle powering off the device until we provide a mechanism
that can do so safely in an automated way.

Do you think there's no way we can get it to work, instead of giving up
and adding an API that goes in the wrong direction ? :-( I'll give a
talk about the dangers of devm_* at the kernel summit, this is something
I can mention to raise awareness of the issue among maintainers,
hopefully leading to improvements through better reviews.
