Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Thomas, Jonathan, was any progress made to resolve below regression?

Side note: vormally I would not prod you at this time of the cycle, but
with the festive season coming up I thought it would be wise to ask a
bit earlier for a status update.

Ciao, Thorsten
