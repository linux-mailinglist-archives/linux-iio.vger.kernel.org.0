Judging the iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() and iio_get_time_ns(), 
IIO operates with signed timestamps. One being s64, the other int64_t.

So, uint8_t is preferred? I don't really care all that much which of 
these to use - which may even show up as a lack of consistency... I 
think I did use uint8_t when I learned about it - but at some point 
someone somewhere asked me to use u8 instead.. This somewhere might have 
been u-boot though...

So, are you Suggesting I should replace u8 with uint8_t? Can do if it 
matters.

What is the proper bitwise type in this case?

I'll explain my reasoning:
What we really have in hardware (BM1390) and read from it is 8bit 
registers. This is u8 to me. And as we read two consecutive registers, 
we use u8 arr[2]. In my eyes it describes the data perfectly well, right?

As I explained above, to me it seems ur arr[2} is _the_ proper type to 
represent data we read from the device.

What we need to do is to convert the 16bits of data to an integer we can 
give to the rest of the system. And, we happen to know how to 
'manipulate' the data to get it in format of understandable integer. As 
we have these 16 bits in memory, aligned to 2 byte boundary - why 
shouldn't we just 'manipulate' the data and say - here we have your 
integer, please be my guest and use it?

Well, I am keen to learn the 'correct bitwise type' you talk about - can 
you please explain me what this correct type for two 8bit integers is? 
Maybe I can improve.

Agree. This is a good practice. Thanks. (although, it shouldn't really 
matter here as nobody really should squeeze a value in between as enum 
is short and we have this just comment above).

The new macro "thingee" for C++ destructor like constructs?

TBH, I am not really in a rush with it for two reasons.
1) The syntax looks very alien to me. I would like to get some time to 
get used to it before voluntarily ending up maintaining a code using it. 
(I don't like practicing things upstream as practicing tends to include 
making more errors).

2. Related to 1). I am not (yet) convinced incorporating changes in 
stuff using these cleanups is easy. I'm a bit reserved and would like to 
see how things play out.

3. I expect I will get a few requests to backport the code to some older 
kernels used by some big customers. (I've been doing plenty of extra 
work when backporting my kernel improvements like regmap_irq stuff, 
linear ranges, regulator pickable ranges, gts-helpers to customer 
kernels to get my drivers working - or working around the lack of thiose 
features. I have been willing to pay this prize to get those helpers 
upstream for everyone to use. The cleanup.h however is there so it does 
not _need_ new users. I don't think _all_ existing drivers will be 
converted to use it so one more should probably not hurt. I think that 
in a year at least some customers will be using kernel containing the 
cleanup.h - so by latest then it is time for me to jump on that train. I 
hope I am used to reading those macros by then).

In my eyes avoiding the very simple if - else if does not warrant nested

I wouldn't say it is an error condition. It just means there was no 
samples collected in buffer.

  and previous branch has

Yes. For the clarity we definitely should explicitly do "return 0" here. 
Thanks.

Oh, thanks! This really, rather requires a clean-up. It looks like a 
left over from the version where I supported setting the number of 
samples to average.
