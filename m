Good find by the way.  Not sure how we never hit this before as there
are definitely sensors out there with similar mixes to you have.
Maybe they are always used with the timestamp enabled?  Anyhow, no
matter it's clearly wrong.

Lars trick doesn't work either (I think) as we can have

u16
u16 (might be padding or real channel)
u32
u16

which should be 4 byte aligned.

I think we need to keep track of the largest element present during
the loop and use that length afterwards to pad out the end, but only
the end rather than every element.  In theory we can also have
larger elements than the timestamp, so should not do special handling
for that, it's just another element.

I think that ends up effectively a combination of the two suggestions?
