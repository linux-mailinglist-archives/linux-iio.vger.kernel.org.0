The naming of the modifiers is also somewhat confusing. The HW registers
represent the DFT of the input signal, which together with a gain factor
is used to calculate the impedance. Dimensionally the quantities are
admittances. "voltage_real" and "voltage_imag" are therefore not quite
fitting.

Also the sweep setup commands are only run once per buffer (in
ad5933_ring_preenable). This means a buffer can only be used for one
sweep and then has to be disabled and enabled again. As the driver does
not implement any triggers this is right now the only way to start a
measurement.

Do you think it would make sense to implement a user-space trigger to
start a measurement sweep? This would mean that a buffer can be reused.
Right now the "iio_readdev" test program from libiio does not work due
to this behavior. I don't know how this is handled on other IIO drivers.

Lastly, should I CC the original author (Michael Hennerich) going
forward?

Thanks!
