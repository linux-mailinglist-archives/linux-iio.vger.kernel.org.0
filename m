Understood.  +CC William to see if we can form a consensus on how
at least which subsystem to hammer this into :)

It's possible we'll fall back to misc, but if at all possible it would
be better to make whatever extensions are necessary to a subsystem so that
other similar devices end up with a home in the long run.

Key here is definitely documentation!

A quick process comment.  If you agree with something in a review
no need to say that. Just delete the relevant code block from your reply.
Only need to discuss the other stuff!   Reviewers read a lot of email
so cutting down the volume makes them less grumpy :)

We might to make new ABI though.   Need to discuss that against
a description rather than finding it buried deep in code.
One possibility is that we have an events only IIO device
as perhaps this fits better int he events interface (the
timestamp part is problematic though).

IIO timestamps are meant to be useful for aligning multiple data sources. As such, where
we have hardware timestamps we normally attempt to apply a calibration to them so that they
map into the time base of the clocks used for IIO software timestamps.

If that's not possible then we need to think how to indicate to userspace that these
particular timestamps have a different meaning.

Handle that in software.  I assume the hardware is sensible enough to provide
a mechanism to notify you about a single overflow? (so that you don't get a
double overflow without knowing about it?)

If so, use a software counter of larger size and have that not overflow.
Typically a 64 bit counter will do fine for this for much longer than the
device is likely to be running (unless this thing has very high clock rates).

It's not something userspace should ever need to know about.  We have
he equivalent for Performance Monitoring Units (drivers/perf)
There devices generally provide an overflow interrupt to allow us to
keep track of how many overflows have occurred and hence out a timestamp
that doesn't overflow often enough to matter.
