I think you have understood this from the comment further down.  But
key is active_scan_masks is telling the driver what to put in the
buffer via iio_push_to_buffer*().  The driver has to have told
the core what it can provide (available scan masks) and the core is
picking one of those.  So active_scan_mask is always an entry
of available_scan_masks with the special case of no available_scan_masks
meaning any combination of channels is fine.
The chosen value is made up of a superset of the channels enable by
the various consumers: userspace and in kernel consumers. A typical
complex example being a SoC integrated ADCs where a couple of channels
are used for the touch screen and the rest for more general purposes.
In those cases, the in kernel touch screen driver enables the channels
it wants, and the userspace IIO interface might enable some more.
Each consumer just sees what it asks for as the IIO core repacks the
requested channels for each consumer dropping the others (maybe
leaving some valid data in the padding. I can't remember if we let
that happen or not and that code is complex so I'm not going to go
figure it out again today :)  There are some subtle cases around
consumers requesting mutually exclusive sets. We also never really
dealt with how to negotiates sample rates etc, so this isn't
quite as intuitive as it would ideally be.  E.g. the core could
subsample to meet a lower sampling rate request, but IIRC we just
let the multiple consumers fight it out for control :(

Ah. That's definitely possible. We've found similar problems with the logic
those example tools before and I can see that this case might not have turn=

up much.

Yes, they do need to be ordered.  I'm not sure if that's clearly documented
or not :(  If not, a patch to add docs on that would be welcome.
I don't think it's worth likely complexity of finding the 'smallest match'
and that's not always obvious.  Imagine a driver that as options

[A, B, C, D] and [A, B, C, E] - how to chose?  May well be more efficient
to do one option than the other (require fewer address writes for the in
order one.  Hence order in will matter anyway so we make it matter complete=
ly
with a policy of first match.

> Thanks again - feel like I've learned something today :)
No problem.  Was quite a while ago that we figured out how to make all this
stuff work and I remember it being very fiddle.

Hohum. I should take another spin at our documentation at some point as
I'm sure some of this is less clear than it should be (or not mentioned) :)

Have a few big docs jobs to do (non IIO) at the moment so this will probably
be a 'while'.
