Naming is always fun. I don't want to have combo start picking up IMUs so
we need to be a bit careful.

We could take the approach we have done with proximity and light sensors of effectively
declaring one type to the dominant one.  There it's a bit clearer though - you don't
buy a proximity sensor if you want to just measure light levels.

Here there isn't always a dominant type.  The example here is titled input / output
device so no preference of one over the other.  The GPIO stuff is kind of a feature
bolted on, so ADDAC is generic enough.

For the ad7293 it does call it a Power Amplifiers 'with' the other stuff so maybe
just sticking to amplifier as the type is the way to go. 

Meh, to a certain extent it doesn't matter - we can safely move these around
once we have more of them in the tree.  The adt7316 is still in staging and
is an ADDAC as well so I think we should put that category in for now.
