Bah, I know saw that I messed up in the cover letter. This was the link [1]=
 I wanted
to add. In there, you'll see the RFC patch which already has lots of info. =
It also
has a link to a previous discussion  had with Jonathan about this kind off
arrangement.

You already more or less figured the frontend + backend story in one of you=
r replies.
So, yes the data is received or transmitted (if we think DAC/DDS) by the ac=
tual
converter which makes sense to be seen as the frontend. This connects to an=
other
device capable of handling the high sample rate (typically a core in a FPGA=
) of these
converters. But this is ADI usecase, note that STM also wants to have somet=
hing like
this in order to link devices. Ah, and one of the things that Jonathan want=
s to see
is that only the frontend device exposes the IIO interface to userspace.
