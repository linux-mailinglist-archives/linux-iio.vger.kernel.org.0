I guess that depends on what is regarded as "the framework".  I mean
the PM-runtime code, excluding the bus type or equivalent.

So presumably it will do something to recover and avoid returning the
error in the first place.

From the PM-runtime core code perspective, if an error is returned by
a suspend callback and it is not -EBUSY or -EAGAIN, the subsequent
suspend is also likely to fail.

If a resume callback returns an error, any subsequent suspend or
resume operations are likely to fail.

Storing the error effectively prevents subsequent operations from
being carried out in both cases and that's why it is done.

Well, what do you mean by "the generic code"?

Sure, but this doesn't mean that suspending or resuming the device is
a good idea until the error condition gets resolved.

Well, in general suspending or resuming a device is a collaborative
effort and if one of the pieces falls over, making it work again
involves fixing up the failing piece and notifying the others that it
is ready again.  However, that part isn't covered and I'm not sure if
it can be covered in a sufficiently generic way.
