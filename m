I think I have a rough understanding. I did a Kunit test which goes 
through all the available scales values from the 
gts->avail_all_scales_table and all integration times, and feeds them to 
the logic below. It seems the first culprit is hit by:
val = 0, val2 = 125025502.

Problem is that the 125025502 is rounded. The exact linearized NANO 
scale resulting from time multiplier 128, gain multiplier 1 is 
125025502.5 - which means we will see rounding.

>>
>>> +    if (val2 % 10)
>>> +        val2 += 1;

For a while I was unsure if this check works for all cases because I see 
linearized scales:
250051005 - multipliers 1x, 64x
83350335 - multipliers 3x, 64x and 6x, 32x
27783445 - multipliers 9x, 64x.

For those we will get + 1 added to val2 even though there is no 
rounding. It appears this is not a problem because the 
iio_gts_get_gain() (which is used to figure out the required total gain 
to get the desired scale) does not require the scale to be formed by 
exact multiples of gain.

Still, the check:
 >>> +    if (val2 % 10)
 >>> +        val2 += 1;

seems a bit misleading because only the scales where the NANO accuracy 
is not enough need the + 1. I would at least ask for a comment 
explaining this a bit better :)

Another quick'n dirty way is to simply check if requested scale is one 
of the magic scales where the NANO accuracy is not enough:
41675167(.5)
125025502(.5)
20837583(.75)
13891722(.5)

and handle the rounding only for those (instead of the val2 % 10) - 
still with appropriate comment.

I think it would be very nice if the gts-helpers could do the rounding 
when computing the available scales, but that'd require some thinking. 
Fixup patch is still very welcome ;)

I did avoid this issue with BU27* drivers earlier because I was able to 
select the maximum scale so that the NANO accuracy was enough since I 
used these helpers for the intensity channels.
