Hi William,

Thanks

I haven't thought about it.
I can add a MAINTAINERS entry, yes!
Who would you suggest ?

I had the same reaction when trying to use it. Then, I figured out
several tools redefine this macro.
Digging further, I just found out some tools have in their Makefile CFLAGS:
-I$(srctree)/tools/include
and include from there: <linux/kernel.h>

I'll update the Makefile in v2, and remove this definition from here.

Ah yes, It's a mix of bad copy paste and updates. I'll fix it.

I'll look forward in the direction you propose. First, we need to
confirm in which form the arguments can be expected. It depends on your
proposal to use a --watch string formatted arguments.

Ack, I can remove this.

I'm a bit surprised by this statement. I may be wrong... I'd expect a
userland binary to be compatible when updating to a newer kernel: e.g.
user API (ABI?) definitions to be stable (including enum constants) ?

Thanks for pointing this! So definitely a good pointer, and suggestion
to look at!

I'll try to improve in v2.

Yes, this could be error prone. This is also why I added a print of the
gathered arguments when using --debug option.
Perhaps this could be better to always print it (e.g. print_watch()) ?

I like the idea, to concatenate as a string. With current approach, the
command line quickly becomes very long.

It makes it obvious in your example, that two watches are used, and no
argument is omitted.
On the opposite, each argument isn't very easy to understand compared to
plain text definition.

Indeed, by using a single letter, we could face limitations (ex:
overflow, underflow, overflow_underflow, which letter for the 3rd here?)

If we go this way, probably need to brainstorm a bit.

I'm not 100% sure if some helpers like getopt() will help here? So, I
guess this could be more complicated. This may also be against the
guideline "options should be preceded by the '-' delimiter character."
in [^1] (Ok, this would rather be the --watch option, fed with watch data.)

Would you have suggestions regarding possible helpers ? Or do you have
