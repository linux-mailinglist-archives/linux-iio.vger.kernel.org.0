I think the main issue is that platform drivers are being asked to do
too much. We've put the burden on platform driver authors to intimately
understand how their devices are integrated, and as we all know they're
not very interested in these details because they already have a hard
time to write a driver just to make their latest gizmo whir. Throw in
power management and you get these wrappers that try to compartmentalize
power management logic away from the main part of the driver that's
plugging into the driver subsystem because the SoC integration logic is
constantly changing but the device core isn't.

We need to enhance the platform bus layer to make it SoC aware when the
platform device is inside an SoC, or "board" aware when the device lives
outside of an SoC, i.e. it's a discrete IC. The bus layer should manage
power state transitions for the platform devices, and the platform
drivers should only be able to request runtime power/performance state
changes through device PM APIs (dev_pm_*). If this can all be done
through genpds then it sounds great. We may need to write some generic
code for discrete ICs that enables regulators and then clks before
muxing out pins or something like that. Obviously, I don't have all the
details figured out.

The basic idea is that drivers should be focused on what they're
driving, not navigating the (sometimes) complex integration that's
taking place around them. When a device driver probe function is called
the device should already be powered on. When the driver is
removed/unbound, the power should be removed after the driver's remove
function is called. We're only going to be able to solve the power
sequencing and ordering problem by taking away power control and
sequencing from drivers.

This API is implemented now.

Can you describe the error scenario further? I think it's driver author
error that would lead to getting and enabling the regulator after
getting and enabling a clk that drives out a clock signal on some pins
that aren't powered yet. I'm not sure that's all that much easier to do
with these sorts of devm APIs, but if it is then I'm concerned.

I agree with Mark, the stick isn't working. We discussed these exact
same issues for years with the devm clk get APIs. Search the archives.
