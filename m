Until I read the example, I totally missed what you want here...

Can you point me to some existing bindings?

IIRC, Linus has expressed not caring for cases of using GPIO API on 
things that are not GPIOs. That was more like registers which can 
read the state of signals. Better let him weigh in before we go too far 
down this path.

The above seems reasonable to me.

Just to throw out an alternative, phandle values of 0 and -1 are 
generally reserved. Historically that means just skip the entry. 
However, you could use that and do something like this:

mode-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
             <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
             <0>,
             <0xffffffff>;

So 0 means low and ~0 means high. The only advantage I see with it is 
you don't need a "fixed-gpios" driver. Also, I'm not sure how that would 
work with requesting GPIOs given you've essentially defined only 2 GPIO 
lines (high and low). Though Bartosz is doing some work on non-exclusive 
GPIOs.
