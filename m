It's unusual to have compatibles for packaging alone and I couldn't find
any clear references to the variants.  Maybe best we can do here is
add a bunch of documentation.

My inclination is to probably not add the compatibles for those until we
do have that information.

I think I got thrown by the large number of choices for a single interrupt.
Flexibility of interrupt routing is common but I've never seen 4 choices for
a single interrupt before :)

More obvious is always good, but you are probably right and I was just
not terribly awake when I wrote that :)

True, I got that backwards.

Yes that sounds good to me.  I just don't like magic numbers
in bindings if we can avoid them.   With the above a reader should
be able to figure out what is going on without reading this doc.

Ah. Yes, with an array and maxItems this will be fine I think.

Another approach would be to 'always' provide those diagnostic channels
but not via buffered interface (if that's sensible to do).  Then potentially
drop them from this binding?

Maybe waiting for customer demand is the best way to go.  Even if you
added a path to read them without them being in DT later it should be
easy enough to maintain backwards compatibility.
