That would be great.

The last go at this was probably this one.

People used to sometimes be on IRC but I'm not sure anyone is any more :(
I rarely joined because of network restrictions at work.

It's fine to ask questions on this mailing list though.
Nature of kernel development is that people need to get good at skipping
threads they aren't interested in!
