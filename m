Where would this get documented?

This is how it currently works for userspace. Only one process can create
the event fd, and everyone else gets -EBUSY.

Of course, it would be pretty surprising to have an IIO device where
some channels were used by userspace and others were used by hwmon and
then have your daemon stop working after you update your kernel because
now the hwmon driver takes exclusive event access.

I originally had kernel users read from the kfifo just like userspace,
but I was concerned about the above scenario.
