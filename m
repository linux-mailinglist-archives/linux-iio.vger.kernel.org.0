Consistency matters, since I do not know the intention behind, I suggest use
either, but be consistent in the entire code. However, uXX are specific Linux
kernel internal types and some maintainers prefer them. Also you may grep for
the frequency of intXX_t vs. sXX or their unsigned counterparts.

Two different registers?! Why bulk is used in that case?
To me looks like you are reading 16-bit (or one that fits in 16-bit) register
in BE notation.

Because it smell like a hack and is a hack here.
Either it's a single BE16 register, or it's two different registers that by
very unknown reason you are reading in a bulk. The code in this form is no
go.

If the registers are not of the same nature the bulk access is wrong.
Use one by one reads.

This, btw, looks like le24, but I'm puzzled with right shift.
I need to read datasheet carefully to understand this.

Right, but code can be done more robust against these. I do not see any
argument against this. It's cheap and correct to add assignments and
then we do not care about the sequence, even if somebody messes it up.

Returning ret suggests otherwise.

But as you explained below, the code is actually 0 there.
In any case bailing out conditionals are better to be first.
