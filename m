You are correct Guenter, we are not talking kernel space here.
But the user land "driver" dbus-sensors with entity-manager as well this 
is all part of OpenBMC which is built on OpenEmbedded and Yocto.

I believe Ed and I are in agreement with "A kernel driver for DPS310 
should report pressure and temperature data, not anything else that may 
be derived from it."

Thank you for you validation of our conclusion; much appreciated.
(It is far easier when build something for the first time to get done 
correctly.)
