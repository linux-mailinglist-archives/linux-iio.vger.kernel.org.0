Yes - but that's because it's new - most of the stuff in 6.8 was the proof
points for the patches originally introducing support for autocleanup (so typically
one or two cases for each type of handling) That doesn't mean we don't want it
in drivers that are being worked upon if it gives a significant advantage.
Some features we need will merge shortly, and a great deal more usage
of this autocleanup will occur.

Why is that relevant to this patch which isn't using that interface at all?
Those protections are to ensure that a consumer driver doesn't access a removed
IIO device, not accesses directly from userspace.

Identify what your locks are protecting.  Those existence locks have
very specific purpose and should not be relied on for anything else.

If this driver is protecting state known only to itself, then it must
be responsible for appropriate locking.

Generally if working on a driver and you see cleanup that you think should
be done, it belongs before any series adding new features, precisely because
that code can typically end up simpler as a result.  This sounds like one
of those cases.  Normally that only includes things that are directly related
to resulting code for new features (or applying the same cleanup across a driver)
as we don't want to make people do a full scrub of a driver before adding
anything as it will just create too much noise.

So for this case, it does look like a quick use of guard(mutex) in
a precursor patch will simplify what you add here - hence that's a reasonable
request for Andy to make.
