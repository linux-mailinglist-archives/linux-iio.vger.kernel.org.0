Great, thanks!

Thank you for all the time you put in these reviews.

I wrote most of it, it's not very long but I tried to cover most of the
common interactions with the core. It is under internal review, I'll
certainly show you its content before publishing in case you have
comments or spot any mistake.

Hehe :) I know, documentation is always a good-to-have item that is not
often reached... I feel I need more occasions to work in the IIO
area (for example with hardware fifos/buffers or events) before being
able to fully appreciate the internal design, but I agree having a set
of 'usual patterns' that drivers should conform with depending on the
devices capabilities/constraints would be a must.

In the mean time, let's start by clarifying this 'iio_dev->modes'
property :)

Thanks,
