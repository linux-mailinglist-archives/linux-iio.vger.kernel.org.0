Your aggregate device (that we can think of as a frontend device needs to
properly reference all the backends it needs - in your case I guess it's ju=
st
one device). The dts properties I have for now are 'converters' and 'conver=
ter-
names'. But one thing that starts to become clear to me is that I should
probably change the name for the framework. Maybe industrialio-aggregate.c =
if we
keep the component API (and so the same frontend + backend naming) or just
industrialio-backend.c (as you have now) if we go with a typical OF lookup.

>=20

Sure. I think one backend might be used as frontend in another aggregate de=
vice,
using the component API, but I'm 100% sure. So, yeah, something to keep in =
mind
and test with some dummy setup.

My idea is to still make use of standard IIO attrs but with a more fine gra=
ined
approach on the callback. Here is what I reasoned about in the other thread=
:

"There are some IIO attributes (like scale, frequency, etc) that might
be implemented in the soft cores. I still didn't made my mind if I should j=
ust
have a catch all read_raw() and write_raw() converter_ops or more fine
tuned ops. Having the catch all reduces the number of ops but also makes
it more easier to add stuff that ends up being not used anymore and then
forgotten. There are also cases (eg: setting sampling frequency) where
we might need to apply settings in both the frontend and the backend
devices which means having the catch all write_raw() would be more
awkward in these case. I'm a bit more inclined to the more specific ops."
