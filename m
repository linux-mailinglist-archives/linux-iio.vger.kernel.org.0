As per my understanding, mtk-pwm-disp is chained to other multimedia features of
the display block of MediaTek SoCs, such as the AAL (adaptive ambient light),
CABC (content adaptive backlight control) etc, other than being a normal(ish)
PWM... that's the reason of my request.

Moreover, in the end, this PMIC's backlight controller is just a "fancy" PWM
controller, with OCP/OVP.

 From how I understand it - yes: we have a fancy PWM (&pwm0) that we use
to control display backlight (backlight-pwm)...

Obviously, here we're not talking about OLEDs, but LCDs, where the backlight
is made of multiple strings of WhiteLED (effectively, a "pwm-leds" controlled
"led-backlight").

Using PWM will also allow for a little more fine-grained board specific
configuration, as I think that this PMIC (and/or variants of it) will be
used in completely different form factors: I think that's going to be both
smartphones and tablets/laptops... and I want to avoid vendor properties
to configure the PWM part in a somehow different way.

For OCP and OVP, the only bindings that fit would be regulators, but that's
not a regulator... and that's about it - I don't really have arguments for
that.

What I really want to see here is usage of "generic" drivers like led_bl
and/or pwm_bl as to get some "standardization" around with all the benefits
that this carries.

That probably depends on how the controller interprets the data, I guess,
but I agree with you on this thought.
