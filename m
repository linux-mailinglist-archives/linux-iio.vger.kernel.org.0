Subject: [PATCH v4 00/48] TI AM437X ADC1

Hello,

This is a (fairly big) series bringing support of AM437X ADC1.
On TI AM33XX SoCs family there is an ADC that can also be connected to a
touchscreen. This hardware has been extended and is present on certain
SoCs from the AM437X family. In particular, the touchscreen has been
replaced by a magnetic card reader. In both cases, the representation is
an MFD device with two children:
* on AM33XX: the touchscreen controller and the ADC
* on AM437X: the magnetic stripe reader and the ADC

This series really targets small and atomic changes so that the overall
review is eased, even though it leads to a lot of rather small patches.
Here are the steps:
* Supporting the missing clock
* Translating a single text file containing the description for the
  MFD, the touchscreen and the ADC into three independent yaml files.
* Cleaning/preparing the MFD driver.
* Supporting ADC1 in the MFD driver.
* Cleaning/preparing of the ADC driver.
* Supporting ADC1 in the ADC driver.
* Updating various device trees.

Here is the full series again, almost reviewed and acked entirely.
The clock patch has been acked, the ADC patches as well, so we expect
the series to go through the MFD tree if the maintainers agree with it.

Thanks,
MiquÃ¨l

Changes in v4:
* R-by/A-by tags added from Tony, Dmitry and Jonathan.
* Inverted the order of three patches following Jonathan's advice:
  removing the ENB macro (and related definitions) should be done first,
  in order to avoid further updates of these useless macros. This lead
  to the addition of a new patch to first do the removal (which was part
  of patch "Drop useless definitions from the header" in the first
  place).
* Updated the naming of the MFD driver data structure as discussed with
  Lee.
* Used the "magnetic stripe reader" wording when appropriate.
* Created a helper using the compatible to determine if there is a
  touchscreen or a magnetic stripe reader in this version of the
  hardware.

Changes in v3:
* Rebased on top of v5.15-rc1.
* R-by/A-by tags added.
* Light reordering to let the of_put_node() fix to be applied more easily
* Dropped a patch made useless because of the previous reordering
* Explained how the tscadc->ctrl variable was used.
* Fixed a couple of typos.
* Included the change for the HZ macro.
* Went further in the BIT()/FIELD_PREP() cleanup.
* Added maximum definitions for sample delay/open delay.
* Removed useless definitions.
* Fixed a couple of rebase conflicts (the series was not bisectable).

Changes in v2:
* Added various R-by/A-by tags.
* Various typos & style fixes.
[Bindings]
* Included the missing ti,am654-tscadc compatible.
* Reworded the compatible lines as requested by Jonathan.
* Reworded the bindings content a little bit as advised by Rob (subnodes
  being objects, MFD descriptions provided once, status and unused
  labels removed).
[SPDX changes]
* Mentioned that the license macro and the license text matched.
* Also added an SPDX tag in the MFD header.
[MFD header]
* Used the BIT(), GENMASK() and PREP_FIELD() macros when relevant.
[MFD driver]
* Did not reordered the variables declared on the probe stack as advised
  by Jonathan.
* Added missing of_node_put() calls.
* Moved the patch changing the place where the main structure is
  allocated to directly precede the patch using this change.
* Fixed the driver data wiring (bug happening between ex patches 16 and
  28).
* Added a commit just to explain the reordering of the register writes
  during initialization/resume.
* Explained the check about 'use_tsc' in the commit message.
* Added a link to the TRM in a commit message referencing it.
* Removed the use of the ti,tracks property, used a constant value
  instead.
* Dropped the error check when retrieving the "wrong" DT property
  (coordiante-readouts) which is unused.
