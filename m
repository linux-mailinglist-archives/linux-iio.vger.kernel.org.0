Ok. So probably the author should be Icenowy as you have it.

ok.  If we can figure that out, seems like co-developed for them as well is=
 appropriate.

Defintely a co-developed for you then!

Lots of co-developed probably most appropriate.  Basically add one for each
SoB other than Iceynow's

ah. Don't use a flag for that, add a little utility function
that takes it as an explicit parameter.  Make sure you wake the device
up using runtime_pm then disable runtime pm before powering it down manuall=
y.

I would.  If something odd is going on a developer can easily
add a check back in to debug it.

ok.  Try and avoid that and just let runtime pm deal with it for you.

For future reference, crop out anything you have commented on in
a review. It saves on scrolling and reduces chances of stuff being
missed in the dicussion.
