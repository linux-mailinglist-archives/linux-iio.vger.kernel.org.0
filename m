No one will. 64 is defined in the datasheet and will never change. I'm
not gonna do anything about it. Actually, I can do something about it.
Remove AD4130_RESET_CLK_COUNT and only define AD4130_RESET_BUF_SIZE as
8.

Actually I just checked, and it's not even needed. The framework
always expects 3 elements for IIO_AVAIL_RANGE. I'll keep those two
3s as they are.

Users can write whatever they want to direct_reg_access. Unless I add
max_register to the regmap_config, the register that the user selects
will just be passed to our reg_read and reg_write callbacks.

Then it will be checked against the register size table.

Yeah, right. I didn't add any error checking because the callback can't
handle errors, so all I can do is print a message to dmesg.

Let's hope other people looking at that code will be able to figure out
what that label does then.

I'm not trying to comact (I guess you meant compact) the sign of any
value. Please try to understand what is written in there. It's not
magic. If the chip is 24bit, and it's set up as bipolar, the raw value
must be offset by -0x800000, to account for 0x800000 being the
zero-scale value. For 16 bits, it's 0x8000.

Please bother reading the macro definition next-time. The mask argument
to FIELD_PREP must be a compile-time constant.

Why would I? The chip can't possibly use regulators with a voltage of 0,
right? Or dummy regulators, since these return negative. I think it's
fine as it is.
