Looks great to me (in fact I just applied it but I'll reply to the cover letter
shortly for that).

Thanks for persisting with this and I'm looking forward to that blog you
mentioned.  If you have time / inclination to help improve the documentation
in the kernel tree that would also be great.  This discussion has made it
clear to me that it would be great to have a set of 'patterns' for common
types of device + how we map them onto the model of IIO (particularly
when they don't quite fit that idealised model).  There are similar
compromises around when to use multiple buffers for instance.

It is always on the list of things to work on but somehow there is always
something else more urgent :(


Thanks,

Jonathan
