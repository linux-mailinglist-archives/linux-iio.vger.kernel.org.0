oops :)  It's fine, I'd just forgotten that discussion entirely!

Ah. Fair enough.  I'm not that bothered so if Andy prefers this then fine to
keep it.

I meant what was going on (the fact it's using autosuspend for example)
could be visible where it is called in a way that is hidden by the
wrappers.  Not a big thing though.

Ah. Seems I'm being very inconsistent today.  However I would expect
you to need the device to remain powered up until end of probe
(assuming it needs to be powered up to read/write registers?) so indeed
a get to raise the reference count would be the way to ensure that.

Great. That makes sense.

Sorry for the inconsistencies!
