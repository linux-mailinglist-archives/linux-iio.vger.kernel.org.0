These time based controls in IIO are always defined in seconds. You'll have
to correct for the data rate in the driver.

Either just make the available options change with data rate, or have the
driver do a 'nearest possible' choice based on what was requested and what
is possible at the current data rate.

It's more complex but it gives a consistent ABI across devices that work
in many different ways.
