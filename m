Hi Cosmin,

Please wrap at around 70-75 chars for patch descriptions.  That
leaves a bit of room for indenting due to automated tooling
/ email threads before we hit 80 chars.  Definitely don't need
30 chars of room for it!

It seems you hit a lot of things that Rob's bot had found that
you would have seen on doing a build test.  Please make sure
you do one in future to save time!

Please use a cover letter for a series like this. It provides several
advantages:

1) Somewhere to add a brief introduction to the whole series.
2) Place for people to give tags for whole series that the b4 tool
   I use to pick up patches can then automatically find them from.
3) Gives series a nice unified name in patchwork ;)

What are the variants?   They look to possibly be package differences?
+ resolution differences.
They definitely need some description here.
It may make more sense to have one compatible and then some extra
booleans to say what it supported.

Long shot, but do the different packages have different model IDs?
The datasheet says
Model ID: 24-bit WLCSP Model ID. These bits are set by default for each mod=
el and
are read only.  If there is one for each of these models then it would be
better to have a single compatible and do the detection of variant in
the driver.

I'm not immediately spotting the resolution information in the data sheet.
It is marked Preliminary but if there are details missing, please mention
in cover letter so we don't go looking for information that doesn't exist.

This is unusual.  It is probably helpful to add more description to
explain that the data ready/ fifo interrupt can be routed to any of these
pins.

Whilst these are optional in theory, you should call out that they must be
provided if any of the channels use them as a reference.

For the external clocks, can we use the fact that one is supplied
as enough to tell us we should be using them?  Then query the
frequency directly from that clock?

If no clock provided then clearly internal.  All that is
necessary after that is a boolean to control if the CLK output
is enabled or not (and ideally constrain that to only be possible
if in internal clock mode).

If I read things correctly VBIAS_CONTROL is a bitmap across the 16 input li=
nes.
So why use a single value rather than either a list of pins, or a bitmap?

Interesting. So we have a part that has a 16 channel sequencer, but
can you have more channels as long as you don't want them all at once?
For example, I doubt anyone wants to permanently configure a device to moni=
tor
the various supplies, but they will want to occasionally.

As such, perhaps we need to treat this device more flexibly?
There are obviously contraints on what channels + references make sense
but maybe we should allow more than 16 to be specified?

That's not a good idea if it might be turned off...
Perhaps a better approach would be to drop the int_ref_en and
simply walk the channels to find out if any of them use it.
If they don't turn it off, otherwise leave it on.
