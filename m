We could but given VND isn't really that special in this case I think
I'd prefer a fixed voltage reg of 0V if someone does wire it like that.
(I think that works, though not sure I've tried a 0V supply ;)

It might indeed.  But I think that's an exercise for the future if
it matters.  Might be a debugfs control only perhaps.

Agreed - it needs more detail.
