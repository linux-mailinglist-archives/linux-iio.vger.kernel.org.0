I like that approach :) Luckily, this was just a sensor. It was much 
more painful back in the Nokia when some of the BTS variants were 
cancelled. It flushed 'man years' of work instead of 'man months' :)

Yes! It wasn't all wasted effort!

No.

...tell me about it... Well, I tried to send feedback - but I am not 
convinced this is not happening again. I think I could fill a book with 
feedback which has had not been listened in the past - but who knows, 
occasionally feedback also works. So, we can keep trying. :)

I've drafted most of the changes and it seems they are more or less 
trivial. I've not yet received the hardware so the changes are 100% 
untested though.

Indeed. Almost as interesting as having patches for a new product in 
your "to be sent" - folder for 3 years waiting for the product to launch 
to get permission to send the patches... Don't we all love maintaining 
off-tree patches when we have that creeping feeling the patches will 
never be allowed to be sent...? Asking for a friend :rolleyes:

Yours,
