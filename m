So we want to have a high-speed interface where buffers of samples are 
passed around between IIO devices and other devices (e.g. USB or 
network), or made available to userspace without copying the data.

DMABUF is, at least in theory, exactly what we need. Quoting the 
documentation 
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.15/driver-api/dma-buf.html):
"The dma-buf subsystem provides the framework for sharing buffers for 
hardware (DMA) access across multiple device drivers and subsystems, 
and for synchronizing asynchronous hardware access. This is used, for 
example, by drm ´prime¡ multi-GPU support, but is of course not 
limited to GPU use cases."

The problem is that right now DMABUF is only really used by DRM, and to 
quote Daniel, "dma-buf looks like something super generic and useful, 
until you realize that there's a metric ton of gpu/accelerator bagage 
piled in".

Still, it seems to be the only viable option. We could add a custom 
buffer-passing interface, but that would mean implementing the same 
buffer-passing interface on the network and USB stacks, and before we 
know it we re-invented DMABUFs.

Cheers,
-Paul
