I am extremely conservative what comes to adding unit tests. I have seen 
some projects where the amount of existing unit test code made code 
changes very much very slow - stopping people doing any improvements. 
Basically, no one wanted to touch the existing code unless it was 
absolutely must because even a minor code change caused several tests to 
break. OTOH, that unit test setup did not only test that end result of a 
function was expected - it did also check the calls done from the 
function to be tested - checking for example that the certain prints 
appeared with certain inputs and so on. That project stopped being fun 
very quickly...

But yes. After spending a while reading IIO code, I agree that _some_ 
parts of it could benefit from a few carefully designed unit tests. (And 
sorry, I haven't checked what tests are existing already - so may be 
there already is relevant tests) :) Channel data demuxing and the mask 
handling are indeed the first to come to my mind ;) I wouldn't dare to 
touch that part without some testing.

Hey, we need to have something for tomorrow, right? :)

Ah. In case where we have bitmap consisting of many longs. Indeed. By 
the way, I think I stole this check from the actual matching code - we 
should probably fix it as well.

After you pointed out the problem in for-condition - it probably does 
not work for all cases.

I probably thought about the num_masks == 0 when adding this check. 
Decided we might just early exit while checking.

I'm fine with dropping the comment. My mindset is easily leaning too 
much on developing new drivers when I think of checks like this one. 
It'd be nice to get a noticeable kick immediately when developing a 
driver - but yes, one should be kicked just by the warning alone.
