This does not feel right and the +1 does not ring a bell to me. I need to investigate what's going on. It would help if you could provide the values used as val and val2 for the setting.

Also, I assume that if we "hack" just the available-scales and don't fix the rest of the logic, setting 6945862 will read back as 6945861 (I haven't tested this though). Also, the 20837583.75 will be 20837583 in available-scales but 20837582 when read back, resulting small error. (I haven't tested this either but I assume the current GTS code is flooring the 20837583.75 to 20837583.

Hi Matti,
Sorry, got busy with my full time job.
It's nice to see that you have found the issue without my test results:)

Please find below my tests -

root@stm32mp1:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# cat scale_available
14.009712000 4.669904000 2.334952000 1.751214000 1.556634666 0.875607000 0.778317333 0.583738000 0.437803500 0.291869000 0.218901750 0.194579333 0.145934500 0.109450875 0.097289666 0.072967250 0.048644833 0.036483625
0.024322416 0.018241812 0.012161208 0.006080604
root@stm32mp1:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# echo 0.875607000 > scale ## This works
root@stm32mp1:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# echo 0.097289666 > scale ## This fails
root@stm32mp1:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# echo 0.097289667 > scale ## However if I add 1, it works! I figured, its a rounding issue so used this trick: "if (val2 % 10) val2 += 1;"
I am sorry, I haven't gone through the full gts internals and only used your driver as a reference to understand it's implementation. I do not have any thoughts on top of my head now but let me go through the code.
