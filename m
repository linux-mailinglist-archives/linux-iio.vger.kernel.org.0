Hmm. That's certainly a bit more complex than I expected.
Relying on the brief description led me astray.

It's related to the differences in the measured and  as if
theta =3D=3D phi and A1 =3D=3D A2 (ideal) then it will be A1.

I can see it's relevant to DOS, but not LOS.  The description of LOS
seems to overlap a number of different things unfortunately.

Probably best to introduce that monitor signal though we'll have
to be a bit vague about what it is which has the side effect that
anyone trying to understand what on earth these faults are is going
to be confused (having read the datasheet section a couple of times
I'm not 100% sure...)

Tricky indeed.  Though I guess we only hit the clipping case after
LOS or DOS fires or if their thresholds are set too wide (is that
even possible?).  So it is useful to report it as we are already in
error? Or can we combine the cases by treating it as a cap on the
threshold controls for LOS and DOS?

Even when they aren't just there for error reporting, designers
seem to always come up with new create signals to use for event
detection and sometimes it's a real struggle to map them to
something general.
