I was CC'd due to the GTS (gain-time-scale)-helpers. The above is the 
beef of those helpers - which, attempt to aid drivers to convert the 
impact of the hardware gain + integration time into a single scale 
value. This approach has some caveats, but the goal is to fulfill the 
expectations of those user-space apps which expect only scale to change 
the gain, while also need to have the integration time controllable (for 
example to reduce the measurement time for one reason or another).

Problem is that, especially when there are multiple channels with 
separate gain control but common integration time, there will be some 
situations where the integration time change _will_ cause changes to 
"total gain (E.g. scale)" too. There may also be cases where some scale 
values can be met only with certain integration times, or where a scale 
for a channel can't be met maintaining the scale for other channels etc.

All in all, I am not sure if the 'unchangeable hardware gain' approach 
makes things as simple as possible - but as long as we want to have it, 
the GTS helpers may be of use :) There are couple of drivers using them 
- feel free to take a look. "git grep gts_ drivers/iio/light/" should 
point you the current users.

Seems it doesn't take much to be an expert XD

I have understood that the simplest way to go is to always use the 
maximum integration time which provides the required scale. This should 
probably result the most accurate readings. If users for some reason 
want to explicitly set a shorter time, then the GTS helpers might be useful.

The GTS helpers can (or, at least should be able to) calculate the 
available_scales. AFAIR they offer two approaches for this. First one is 
listing _all_ scales which can be achieved by changing both the 
integration time and the hardware gain. The second one lists only the 
scales which can be set with the currently selected integration time.

I think that all of the current GTS users use this first approach of 
listing all the values, so the 'per time tables' - approach is not very 
thoroughly tested. Please, let me know if you hit to any hiccups.

Yours,
