I have a feeling I have misunderstood how this mask works. I have 
assumed all the channels with corresponding mask bit _can_ be enabled 
simultaneously, but I have not understood they _must_ all be enabled. I 
think I must go back studying this, but if all channels really _must_ be 
enabled, then you are correct. It actually makes a lot of sense to 
support the pressure values alone, as, according to the data-sheet, the 
HW is doing a "MEMS temperature compensation" to the pressure values. 
So, my assuimption is the temperature data may not be required to be 
captured.

This also means I should revise the scan masks for the BU27008, BU27010 
and BU27034 light sensors as I don't think all the users want all the 
channels enabled. I wonder how I have not noticed any problems when I 
tested those things - did I really always enable all the channels...? @_@

Anyways, Thanks.

I must take a look at the IIO_VAL_FRACTIONAL. I think either it or the 
NANO at this point. I have no understanding what is the precision that 
is enough. Hmm.. Would adding the PICO really require a change in 
user-space or could we hide it in-kernel when formatting the value we 
emit via sysfs?

I see now the comment is vague. I think I may originally had the mutex 
locked in this function and the comment has been preceding the lock.

Anyways, how the HW operates is that reading the first pressure value 
from the FIFO makes the sensor to 'start a FIFO access sequence'. So, 
after we read the first pressure value from the FIFO, we must not read 
any other register untill we have read all the pressure values and 
closed the 'FIFO access sequence' by reading the FIFO_LVL. If we do we 
may lose samples. I'll see how to explain this better.

Gah. I hate you Jonathan ;) (Not really!)

Actually, thank you (as always) for pointing this out. I don't instantly 
see why it wouldn't work, but going throught the IRQ races is never 
trivial (for me). It's work I've learned not to do at afternoon as my 
brains work better at the morning :) So, I will still go through this as 
a first thing tomorrow when I start my work day...

Please, see my reply to Andy's comment. I'll paste it to this message

Andy did also suggest using them to me. This is what I wrote as a reply 
to him - I'll copy it as a rationale why I'd rather did the good old 
goto-unwinding here at least for now...

OK.

I think I can live with what you suggest here :)

Another good question. I know I wrote the code only thinking that when 
the trigger is used, it will be the data-ready from the device. I think 
I even used the trigger validation function which requires us to use the 
device's own trigger.

Now, whether it would make sense to allow other triggers, and whether 
the trigger handler has any data-ready specific handling here is 
something I need to revise. What does slightly bug me with allowing 
other triggers is that as far as I remmeber the BM1390 had no way to 
indicate that a single sample was actually ready. So, when we use any 
other trigger it may be we don't have a valid sample to read. (The 
read_raw uses a delay which should be long enough to guarantee a sample).

Thanks for pointing this out. In my mind the trigger and buffer went 
hand to hand with this device. Now, after your previous comment, I need 
to rethink if they really can be sepated. Anyways, moving this makes sense.

The request_threaded_irq will use the dev_name() if NULL is passed to 
it. I think it should be fine - but I think this is not worth fighting 
if you strongly prefer the check :)

I can change this if you feel strong about it. Still, I personally find 
assignments in declarations less clear and so I tend to avoid them. 
(There's a few exceptions like repeated private data pointer getting).

I agree. I may have just accidentally added the regulator stuff in 
between device alloc and getting the 'data'-pointer.

I really seem to be babbling... :) Thanks for the distilled version :)
