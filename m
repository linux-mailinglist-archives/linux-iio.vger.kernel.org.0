Far as the kernel is concerned this is a __be16 and we use a bulk read to
fill it from two registers.  If the use showed them having unrelated uses
then it would be fair to handle it as an array of u8.

Read it directly into a __be16

I'm not convinced it does.  All support arch are 2s complement.
be16_to_cpu() is fine for what you have unless I'm missing something.
If it weren't we would have signed versions of those macros.

These cases are harder to argue.  I'm fine with either approach for this one
as a get_unaligned_le24() >> 2 would give same answer unless I'm also missing
something but it isn't that obvious.
