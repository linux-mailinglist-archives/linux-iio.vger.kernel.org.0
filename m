I tried to prototype setting scan_index to -1, but when registering channels I saw

[    1.637049] iio iio:device0: tried to double register : in_voltage_raw
[    1.637245] xilinx-ams ffa50000.ams: Failed to register sysfs interfaces
[    1.637433] xilinx-ams: probe of ffa50000.ams failed with error -16

And AIUI .channel is filled in by ams_parse_firmware.
