Subject: [PATCH 0/8] DEV_PM_OPS macros rework

Hi,

This set of commits rework a bit the *_DEV_PM_OPS() macros that were
introduced recently.

- Remove the DEFINE_UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() macro, since I highly doubt
  anything is going to use it. The macro it replaces
  (UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS) seems to only be used incorrectly in code that
  hasn't been updated in ages.

- Remove the static qualifier in DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, so that the
  macro is more in line with what's done elsewhere in the kernel.

- Add a DEFINE_RUNTIME_DEV_PM_OPS() macro, for use with drivers that use
  runtime PM, and use runtime_pm_force_suspend/runtime_pm_force_resume
  as their system sleep callbacks.

- Add EXPORT_*_DEV_PM_OPS macros, which can be used for when the
  underlying dev_pm_ops is to be exported. With CONFIG_PM set, the
  symbol is exported as you would expect. With CONFIG_PM disabled, the
  dev_pm_ops is garbage-collected along with the suspend/resume
  callbacks.

- Update the two places which used DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, to add back
  the "static" qualifier that was stripped from the macro.

- Update one driver to use EXPORT_RUNTIME_DEV_PM_OPS(), just to showcase
  how to use this macro in the case where a dev_pm_ops is to be
  exported.
  Note that the driver itself is GPL, and the symbol is only used within
  a GPL driver, so I would assume the symbol would be exported as GPL.
  But it was not the case in the original code, so I did not change the
  behaviour.

Feedback welcome.

Cheers,
-Paul
