No, this is just a scaling factor which is moments later
eliminted by a matching inverse operation. It's math purely
about attempting to preserve precision and has nothing to do
with the units of the values that are involved.

No, in the context of B) it's also just math without any physical
quantity in the back seat. The iio core prints fractional-log
*values* (of any and all units) with "nano precision" i.e. nine
decimal digits.

What I meant originally by "no correct define to use" is that
there are arguments for both GIGA and for NANO and that if both
are not wrong, then none of them is /the/ correct define to use.
Now that you put the focus on physical quantities, there are
other ascpects, see below.

This doesn't really parse for me. What question is "yes" answering?
What is it that you think is correct and what is incorrect? I.e. what
is your conclusion? Do you think NANO or GIGA fits best? Why?

Yes, but I wonder if it is worth the time to work out what the
correct defines to use actually are.

I don't get what is supposed to be funny. Which would I be and
why? I of course saw the difference in exponents, what I don't
see is why dividing with 10^-9 makes the result NANO while
multiplying with 10^9 (presumably) makes the result GIGA. And
yes, sigh, I do see that you have divisions above and not any
multiplication, but what's confusing me is what happens when I
extend your example with the multiplications I added below. I
simply cannot make up clear rules with only numbers to go by.
I for one need the units to make the call. But we have units
neither here nor in the math the code is implementing, it's
only plain numbers (or numbers with unknown units, or ops where
the unit is of no consequence).

See above.

Only if you select the correct and relevant define. Otherwise they
make things random and confusing. You can't go hunt for a define
that happens to match the value you need and then argue it's a
good idea to use it based on that. And this borders to that,
because in 3 of 5 cases there are no units involved and the
defines are about unit prefixes. In the remaining two cases (that
you elided) the actual unit prefix involved (from micro-ohms) is
not considered and MEGA is used instead of MICRO.

Oh, I have a good understanding of how this driver works and where
the numbers are coming from. I have no issues to solve in that
department. And I like to keep it that way, so I want to understand
which of GIGA and NANO is better than the other, and why. For each
instance.

Not helpful. You seem to be under the impression that all 10^x
numbers are somehow used because there is a unit connected to some
other number. That's simply not always the case.

Right, that's arguably a mistake. Here, 1000000000 is simply the
number that's needed to adjust the 9 decimal digits for the
int-plus-nano return value, whatever unit that int-plus-nano
value has. So, there is only a match with the above from the
