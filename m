Packaging + available interrupt pins + resolution. Is having extra
booleans to describe what is supported really the best approach?
It's not really about how the hardware is configured anymore, is it?
They're different chips.

I don't have enough information about the other models to know what
Model IDs they will have. That's why I took this approach.

Is it unusual? ADIS16480 follows a similar approach.

description: |
   Specify which interrupt pin should be configured as Data Ready / FIFO
   interrupt.
   Default if not supplied is dout-int.

How does this sound?

I thought that "Can be used as reference for conversion." + it being an
option in adi,reference-select property would make it obvious, no?

Aren't we supposed to set the frequency of that clock ourselves,
in the driver?

Well...

So, mclk present => external, not present => internal.
adi,int-clk-out-enable to specify if the internal clock should be
exposed? adi,ext-clk-freq to specify the desired clock speed of the
external clk?

Umm. Isn't this a list of pins? That's why everything is plural here.
I guess I should add `maxItems: 16`?
I already added `$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array`.

Ehhhhh. Look at the driver. It's already pushing 2k+ lines with
the 8 setups for 16 channels situation + all the extra options the
chip provides. If we also make it so that channels are rewritten at
runtime, it will turn into a mess. Or at least I don't see a clean
way of adding that. Besides, then I'd have to do all these extra
allocations depending on the number of channels in the device tree...
It gets complicated. If a customer expresses his interest in this,
I guess I'll have to add it.
Also, presumably the extra inputs are marketed as diagnostics.
