Thanks for your feedback. Yes, my feeling is that the API I need for the 
dfsdm use case, can be covered by the API you propose. I'm not familiar 
with component API however, as I discovered it in your serie. It is not 
clear for me how this affects device tree description of the hardware. 
So I need to take time to look at existing examples.
I think I need also to try a template implementation of dfsdm use case 
based on your API, to figure out how it could work.

The cascaded use case by itself is not a real requirement for dfsdm use 
case. The idea here was to think about future possible needs, and to 
ensure that the solution is scalable enough. So, it is not a strong 
requirement, but we probably need to keep it in mind.

Yes, It would be nice to have read_raw(), as this allows to stick to 
existing IIO API for standard IIO attributes. But I guess this should 
not be a problem.
