My idea is that the sensor can either be used in two ways,

1. With trigger (data-ready IRQ). In this case the FIFO is not used as 
we get data ready for each collected sample. Instead, for each 
data-ready IRQ we read the sample from sensor and push it to the IIO buffer.

2. With hardware FIFO and watermark IRQ. In this case the data-ready is 
not used but we enable watermark IRQ. At each watermark IRQ we go and 
read all samples in FIFO and push them to the IIO buffer.

Do you mean the commit message should explain this?

It really looks like it's missplaced. I may have suffled some code to 
other place without moving the comment. I'll drop or move it - thanks!

I didn't want to determine success of getting the data by success of 
this read. Instead, I wanted to ret to contain the success of reading 
the pressure in the for-loop. We might spill out a warning if this reads 
fails though.

Yeah :) This was forgotten when I dropped the OVERSAMPLING setting. Need

True. I'm not sure this is worth the complexity though. It'd mean we had 
to support DRDY when in FIFO mode - iff watermark is 1. Currently we 
don't need to bother the DRDY or FIFO disabling when in FIFO mode.

I've learned a hard way that it can be a very good idea to return 
IRQ_NONE if HW access fails in IRQ handling. If we don't (can't) ack the 
IRQ line, we'll be sitting in IRQ handler. The feature which disables 
local IRQ after <N> unhandled IRQs has made a huge difference when I've 
received bug reports from people. Being able to access the device when 
the 'wild' IRQ gets disabled and being able to retrieve the logs is 
priceless. Also, seeing the 'nobody cares, disabling IRQ' in the log is 
a really valuable hint :)

The same story here. If we can't read the samples from the FIFO, we'll 
end up having new watermark IRQ immediately when the oneshot thread 
exits. Returning the IRQ none allows genirq core to disable the host 
side of the IRQ, allowing us to see the 'nobody cared' and go get the 
logs even with single core system.

This may be my limited understanding of how IIO is typically used. To me 
it sounded a bit strange that someone setting trigger could abort an 
ongoing buffered measurement. I would have expected the buffering to be 
explicitly disabled by user before allowing the trigger to be used. 
Especially because the trigger and FIFO are pretty much exclusive 
features (as with data-ready trigger you'll get each individual sample 
read). My assumption was that an attempt to enable data-ready when FIFO 
was in use is a misconfiguration.

Well, the mode needs to be set to continuous even for a single shot 
measurement when IIR filter is used. Furthermore, if we use the 
single-shot mode, then the mode must be re-written to register after 
every colleted sample. Hence we set the continuous mode also when 
trigger is used.

It might be we could set this mode already at probe and forget it then. 
Well, maybe it has some impact to power consumption (?) so perhaps we 
just leave the continuous mode to be enabled for all, triggered, FIFO 
and raw sample collections.

comment does not eat cycles :) Well, I know everyone is saying this does

Thanks for the explanation. It makes sense.
Meanwhile I was reading the spec and I think the FIFO_FULL usage with 
this IC is like asking for a nose-bleed. FIFO_FULL IRQ is acked by 
reading the status - and if data is not read from the FIFO, then the 
status will remain cleared (and I assume also the IRQ line will stay 
low). I assume it's easy enough to write a code that acks the IRQ while 
leaving the buffer full - and effectively killing the FIFO_FULL IRQ. No 
more samples for you then.

I wouldn't say there is anything really slow. What I have gathered is:

1) The grand idea is that at the end of the day (week, month, year) 
async probing should be the default when it causes no problems.

2) Problems are rare (although they may exist).

3) All regulator drivers were changes (or suggested to be changed) to do 
async probing because for example the ramp-rates may be slow.

4) This driver enables the VDD supply - with potentially slow ramp-rate 
(well, the I need to guess user's setups statement holds again) so it 
may potentially take a while (probably not long though).

5) We have a few msleeps() in bm1390_chip_init() - which are likely to 
result a sleep tens of milliseconds. So there is some delay.

 From those 5 things I derived assumption that async probe would be the 
right thing to start with. We can drop it if it causes a problem in an 
actual setup :)
