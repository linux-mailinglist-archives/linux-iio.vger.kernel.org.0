I know, but this series has to be reverted when the framework is fixed.

devm_kzalloc() doesn't make a difference. The managed memory is freed 
when the parent device is unbound/removed. There may very well be 
reference to the counter_device at this point.

Yes and no, this can trivially be used for privilege escalation, but 
then again on systems with a counter_device probably everything runs as 
root anyway.
