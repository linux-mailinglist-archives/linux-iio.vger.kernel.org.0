That's cool!

No, just in this one.

Currently no, but if someone puts 63 there or 65, what would be the outcome?
OTOH, you may add a static assert to guarantee that CLK_COUNT is multiple of 8.

But does the above mean MILLI or KILO? Similar for the FREQ factor.

I was talking only about 3:s (out array). IIRC I saw 3 hard coded in
the driver, but not sure if its meaning is the same. Might be still
good to define.

But how is it possible? Is the reg parameter taken directly from the user?

Why to check errors in many other cases then? Be consistent one way or
the other.

If it's a dead code, we do not want it.

Wasn't clear to me until I went to the end of each of them (who
guarantees that's the case for all of them?).

1 << 31 is UB in accordance with the C standard.

And the magic above seems to me the opposite to what sign_extend()
does. Maybe even providing a general function for sign_comact() or so
(you name it) would be also nice to have.

      mask = AD4130_WATERMARK_MASK;

      ret = regmap_update_bits(st->regmap, AD4130_REG_FIFO_CONTROL,
                               mask, FIELD_PREP(mask,
ad4130_watermark_reg_val(eff)));

Again, what's the meaning of having it in the conjunction with
dev_err_probe() call?

It's confusing. I believe you need two different messages if you want
to handle the 0 case.

Exactly my point. Why do you check it twice?

You tell me. I have no idea of what the locking schema is being used
in your code.
