Hi,
Did you build the documentation?

Oh, I think you would need to add amd-sfh-hid to
Documentation/hid/index.rst first in order to build the documentation.
That change should be part of your patch set.


So please do that and then run "make htmldocs" and look for warnings or errors.

More below:

Underlines (like above) should be at least as long as the heading line,
but heading lines don't need endings on them like ':' or '-', so please
remove those ending characters on all heading lines.

Use Mailbox and X86 as above for consistency.
