Hi Jia-Ju Bai,

There is a quirk in here thatyou haven't mentioned.  The "magic"
opt->ok_to_ignore_lock.

So there are two cases:
1) No irq in use.  In that case the opt3001_irq() will never run and we
   just sleep + check a status flag. That's the best we can do without
   an interrupt.
2) irq in use, the ok_to_ignore_lock =3D true statement occurs and
   in the opt3001_irq() the locks are never taken hence no deadlock.

It is a very odd bit of code though so I'd be surprised if a static
analyser hadn't highlighted it as a possible deadlock!

Now, I'm not immediately sure why the driver is done like this as opposed
to a more complete wait_for_completion() in read_raw(), complete() in the i=
rq
handler and do the actual read of the data back in read_raw().
It's probably related to the other interrupt sources that we need to
differentiate from in the interrupt handler.

The lock definition is missing an documentation of exactly what it's scope
is which definitely doesn't help us understand this unusual structure.

Thanks,

Jonathan
