Ah.  Not having seen any isolators, I assumed this device was running
against a common ground with the digital side of things.
AVSS to DGND is between -3 and 0.2 so I think there is a ground even if it's
not directly connected.

Given this only operates in differential mode the fact both signals are
referenced to +-vref which is from VASS doesn't matter in the end and any
offset goes away.

So yes I think I agree.  This should be a single supply.
