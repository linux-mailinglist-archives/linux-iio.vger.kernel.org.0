We've become more fussy about it recently but for new bindings at least,
we want to include all power supplies and mark them as required.

A few other trivial things inline,

Should say what A0 and A1 are.  It's down below but seems odd
that it is here for RES0 and RES1 but not the A1 and A0 signals.

That is impressively random ;)  Good to call it out.

What if someone is being odd and connected only 1 of them?
It's annoying how often people run out of pins and do things like this.

Good description as this was non obvious.

I think this allows for both.  It's fiddlier to exclude that but would be a nice
to have perhaps rather than relying on text above that says 'don't do it'.
