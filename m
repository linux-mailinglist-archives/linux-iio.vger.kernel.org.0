Ah I read that backwards as you've noticed.

We don't have any such big channels, so indeed have some flexibility here.
I think we stick to naturally aligned so 16 bytes case would be 16 byte
aligned - mostly because I don't expect to see one any time soon and
because it makes the docs simpler.

Indeed - it's meant to be power of 2 only. More than possible we don't check
that rigorously enough or have it clearly documented though.

The aim is for the data to be padded for efficient accesses
+ because it is a pain to deal with arbitrary padding so we restrict
it to power of 2 naturally aligned only.  One relaxation we've talked
about in the past is packing multiple channels per byte (for logic
analyser cases). Not done it yet though.

16 byte alignement is probably not needed - but who knows for future
architecture. Note this has been really non obvious in the past and
is why we force alignment for timestamp elements in lots of drivers.

Most architectures align an s64 in a c structure to an 8 byte boundary
but x86 32 bit doesn't.  Hence we have to force it all over the place.

Fixing that (because userspace ABI data placement should not vary across
architectures) was a pain. I don't want to do it again!

Might be worth a power of 2 only comment.
