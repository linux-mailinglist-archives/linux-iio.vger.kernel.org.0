I said it on the previous version, but this really seems like it should
be something like "slow-io-gpios". I know Jonathan expressed some
concerns about having to deal with it on the operating system side (as
the pin is either an input & used for this slow-io control, or an output
and used as an interrupt) but that is, in my opinion, a problem for the
operating system & the binding should describe how the hardware works,
even if that is not convenient. With this sort of property, a GPIO hog
would be required to be set up (and the driver for that gpio controller
bound etc before the pac driver loads) for correction functionality if
this property was in the non-default state.

As far as I understand, the same pin on the device is used for both an
output or an input depending on the configuration. As an input, it is
the "slow-io" control, and as an output it is an interrupt.
I think Marius is trying to convey that either this pin can be in
exclusively one state or another.

_However_ I am not sure that that is really the right thing to do - they
might well be mutually exclusive modes, but I think the decision can be
made at runtime, rather than at devicetree creation time. Say for
example the GPIO controller this is connected to is capable of acting as
an interrupt controller. Unless I am misunderstanding the runtime
configurability of this hardware, I think it is possible to actually
provide a "slow-io-gpios" and an interrupt property & let the operating
system decide at runtime which mode it wants to work in.

I'm off travelling at the moment Marius, but I should be back in work on
Monday if you want to have a chat about it & explain a bit more to me?

Cheers,
Conor.
