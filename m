I have gone through tsens and other examples, but I'm not able to get a 
way to apply this kind of constraint, on what child nodes should be present.

In this case, the constraint would have to be that for compatible 
property "qcom,spmi-vadc", there should be at least four child nodes and 
those four should have their "reg" property fixed to the channel values 
mentioned above. I can see how to apply constraints on a single property 
like interrupts in tsens, but I'm not sure if there is a way to specify 
a lower limit to the number of child nodes or something like "there 
should be at least one child node with value 0x9 for its "reg" 
property". I could not find any examples with constraints placed onÂ  
number of occurrences of a child node.

Can you please share an example of such a constraint if you are aware of 
any or suggest some way by which this kind of constraint can be specified?

I'll make the change in the next post.

I'll do this for all properties for which it's applicable in the next post.

<1 3> means it is scaled down to 1/3rd of actual value. I'll add to the
