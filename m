Maybe Jonathan was wrong!  I was younger then than now :)

However, reg values for child nodes are unique so can't just use a flag the=
se
need to be different values.

The <13 10> option makes sense to me and avoids suggesting a common negative
input.

The 'fun' bit here is that diff-channels doesn't actually tell us anything.
So we could just not provide it and rely on documentation of reg =3D 16-19 =
meaning
the current channels?

Hmm.  That whole approach to pseudo differential does get messy if
we have the common line routed through the main MUX rather than an opt
in only on the negative side. =20

If I read this right, its almost a trick to support a pseudo differential
wiring with simple registers (I guess reflecting MUX limitations).

So what could we do?

We could assume that VINCOM is used like a conventional pseudo
differential negative signal and have supply-vincom + non diffferential
channels if that's the configuration wanted.

Then for differential channels can support all the VINX VINX+1
and swapped options.
For VIN10 it gets fun as non differential and differential options
I think map to same actual config.   Don't see reason we need to express
that in the binding though so let that have VIN10 VINCOM (probably using
a magic channel number) and  VIN10 pseudo differential.

Similar setup for ADCIN15 equivalent usage

Code wise this probably won't be particular hard to support in the driver
(obviously I haven't tried though :) is it worth the effort to keep
it inline with other devices that support pseudo differential channesl.

That's an option as well.  In many early drivers we just provided all the
channels. Somewhat depends on whether people buy devices with lots of
channels they don't wire.  Mostly I suspect they don't as that's money
wasted!
