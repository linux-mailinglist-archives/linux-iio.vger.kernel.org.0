There are (at least?) two approaches on the contribution:
1) generic / library wise;
2) specific hardware wise.

You are talking about 2), while my remark is about both. I can imagine a newcomer
who possess a hardware that looks similar to what this driver is for. Now, they
would like to write a new driver (note, that compatibility can be checked by
reading the RTL definitions, so no need to dive into the code) and use this as
a (nice) reference. With that in mind, they can read a function named
get_fifo_bytes() with not so extensive documentation nor fully self-explanatory
name. One may mistakenly though about this as a function for something that
returns FIFO capacity, but in the reality it is current amount of valid / data
bytes in the FIFO for the ongoing communication with the device.

Yeah, I share your frustration and agree that people are loosing the feel of
curiosity. Brave New World in front of us...
