Hi Jonathan.

Thank you very much for the feedback once again. I didn't know that cleanup.h
was a new thing. I also didn't understand it when Andy mentioned it. Now that
I saw it better and I read about it, it certainly looks like a very good thing
to add.

I don't know if I sounded like I didn't like that request, but just to clarify,
I see it as a very good thing all the proposals that you do because first I
get to learn and understand how to write better code and second the users will
use a better driver! So please, the more requests, the better.

So a precursor patch adding the new functionality of the guard(mutex) in this
and possibly other places in the driver will be good indeed, thank you!
