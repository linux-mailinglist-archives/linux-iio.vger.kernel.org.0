Usually there's nothing to do about it. And several late-handled
interrupts can lead to any of 4 errors.

My sensor works around 3 years 24\7 (with one reboot per month) and 
still precise (for home usage at least) - I compared it with several 
other home temperature sensors.

I've just checked another sensor in my setup (3.3v, cable 15cm) the
error rate is the same. So it's ether EMI or single-core slow cpu.

It's not very rare but sure not permanent. It can happen once per 
several hundreds / a thousand requests.

If you don't ask those people to send dmesg with CONFIG_DEBUG is on you 
lost 2 of 4 possible errors and don't see the whole picture. Other 
dev_dbg messages in this driver are rather helpful.

Anyway thanks for that very interesting information. It's not obvious at 
all if you're unfamiliar with protocol and the driver. Probably it 
should be put in some documentation. Without diving into driver's source 
code those messages are just noise.
Still I consider all those cases are purely debug. When there no 
hardware support for sensor's protocol and the kernel is not realtime 
then errors are probable. But often a temp sensor application is
not required to struggle for every measurement. And it's not desirable
to add logrotate to embedded system just because of temp sensor diagnostics.
