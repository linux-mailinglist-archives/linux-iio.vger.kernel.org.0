Hi Julien,

I've taken a cursory look over the TI ECAP reference guide and your
descriptions in this thread. I think a device driver for this would fit
better in the Counter subsystem than IIO.

First I want to correct a minor misunderstanding: the "timestamp"
member of struct counter_event is simply a way to identify Counter
events on the system as a way of grouping multiple Counter watches. In
other words, the "timestamp" member here represents when a Counter event
was detected by the system, not when an event was logged on the counter
device hardware. Instead, hardware timestamps such as the CAPx registers
would be provided by the "value" member of struct counter_event.

Now, I have a few ideas for how we could expose the timestamps using a
Counter device driver, but first I want to make sure I understand
correctly what's happening in this device. If I understand correctly, we
have the following device components:

* CTR: 32-bit counter timer
* Mod4: 2-bit counter
* CAP1-CAP4: four 32-bit registers, each indepedently store a timestamp
* ECAP: input signal providing event trigger edges

Four edge polarities are configured corresponding to each CAPx register,
yet the input signal is still the same single ECAP pin. The event that
is fired is instead determined by the Mod4 counter: when Mod4 is 0 and
the edge of ECAP matches the polarity configured for CAP1 then an event
is triggered which saves the current CTR value to CAP1 and increments
Mod4 to 1, etc.

Is my understanding of how this device behaves correct?

If so, then one possible way to represent this device in the Counter
sysfs tree is something like this:

* CTR: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count0/count
* Mod4: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count1/count
* CAP1: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count1/cap1
* CAP2: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count1/cap2
* CAP3: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count1/cap3
* CAP4: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/count1/cap4
* ECAP: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signal0/signal
* polarity1: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signal0/cap1_polarity
* polarity2: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signal0/cap2_polarity
* polarity3: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signal0/cap3_polarity
* polarity4: /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signal0/cap4_polarity

This is just a tentative arrangement (you could also include "enable"
attributes as well), but it should give you an idea of how it could be
organized.

In your driver, you could then use counter_push_event() whenever you get
an event triggered. In userspace, your application will add Counter
watches for the CAPx registers they want. When an event triggers,
userspace can then received all four CAP register values at the same
time via the respective /dev/counterX character device node.

Would this design work for your needs?
