This looks good to me, other than the custom property, for which I can't
tell if a consensus was reached on last time around.

On the last version, the last comment I could find on lore was
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230609184149.00002766@Huawei.com/
where Jonathan and Rob were discussing whether or not a spi-mux type of
thing could work, but it does not seem to have ended conclusively.

Rob or Jonathan, would you mind commenting on that?

There was also a comment from Jonathan:

The binding does now enforce the vref supply where relevant, but it
sounds like you were looking more supplies to be documented Jonathan?
(AVdd, DVdd etc)

Thanks,
Conor.
