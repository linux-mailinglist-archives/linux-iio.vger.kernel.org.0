Right. A struct is not a problem. I am less fond with an enum because 
the HW channel which carries a specific color may change. I think adding 
an enum which indicates a place where a color is in array may be 
misleading one to think that HW has a fixed channel (data register 
address) for a colour. (I think that is quite usual while ICs where one 
color may be in different channels depending on the config are likely to 
be rare... I haven't read too many light sensor specs/drivers to know 
for sure though).

I'll try improving this and hopefully send a new version later this

Now I see what you meant :) I misread your comment to meant that you 
didn't like the scaling on both sides of the '>'. /me feels slightly stupid.

Thanks again!
