It's a long shot, but this looks pretty close in register map to
the apds9960 in IIO.

Maybe try adding the ID to that driver and cross your fingers?

There is some stuff going on around the register address / commands
that I haven't figured out but it looks similar for the byte access
path and that may be all the IIO driver is using.

If you are fine testing, it's possible someone else might do the
leg work (if me I'll emulate just enough to convince myself I didn't
break it too badly). Won't be high on my list, but maybe I'll get
a boring wet weekend sometime...
