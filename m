I'm not arguing that SPI_READY applies in this particular case, but
FWIW it does seem to me like...

1) SPI_READY could be implemented in any SPI driver using a GPIO
interrupt (similar to how we already have GPIO CS)
2) In cases where the SPI controller does have actual hardware support
for SPI_READY and the ADC chip A) uses CS to trigger a conversion and
B) has a "busy" signal that goes low when the conversion is complete,
then the SPI_READY feature could be used to make reading sample data
more efficient by avoiding any CPU intervention between CS assertion
and starting the data xfer due to waiting for the conversion to
complete either by waiting for an interrupt or sleeping for a fixed
amount of time.
