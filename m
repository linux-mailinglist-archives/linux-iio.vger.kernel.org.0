That's fine.

Using that wired up to buffer mode might make sense.  You'd provide multiple
buffers and allow channels to be selected into one of them at a time. Each
buffer is then tied to a different toggle (TGP0, TGP1, etc)

The same could be true for the software toggle.  It'll get a bit fiddly though.

Perhaps this is an advanced feature to think about later...

I don't follow this bit.  You mean TGPx and software toggle. As far as I can
tell it's an either/or thing per channel.

Only use I can see is to reduce traffic if you happen to be switching between
two sets of DAC outputs repeatedly. If there wasn't an LDAC pin I'd suspect
this was there to enable simultaneous updates but we have that anyway.
Maybe if the LDAC isn't wired this could be used to provide similar
functionality?  If that's the case, we could just leave it as a possible
TODO if anyone wants it in future...
I think you could use the TGPx to provide controlled switching of
sets of channels.  Maybe that's something useful?

Given the mapping of TGPx to channel is a software control I think ultimately
you'd want to expose that - one way I can think of doing that is via
the buffer interface.

4x buffers.  One of each TGP0,1,2 and SW toggle.  Enable the channels you
want for a given 'buffer' and then they will switch together based on the
data in the buffer.  If the buffer has a series of toggling values then
it's simple - if not then after each toggle the buffer would need to preload
the next value.  The snag there is that you'd need to know a toggle occurred
and if the toggle pins are wired to somewhere other than our host I'm not sure
how you would know that in general? (could wire the same TGPx signal to an
interrupt on the host controller but seems unlikely).

Whether software toggle is worth bothering when we have LDAC to control
simultaneous DAC updates isn't clear to me.  I guess it's fewer writes
if we happen to be cycling between values.  Perhaps you are right and that
feature is just for debug.

Whilst I can conjecture reasons to do this, you may well be right - real
usecases will know which signal groups they want to control together.

Does seems unlikely anyone would use dither with a sw toggle.
Perhaps best plan here is to not support that combination.

As to the clock, these are about controlling a sine wave frequency. I'm not sure
decimation fits as a model. (figure 19)

Given you know the input clock, perhaps present this as something like
out_voltage0_dither_frequency

I don't thing dithers are always this simple, so probably want to be specific its
a sine wave so maybe we need
out_voltage0_dither_type 'sine' 

We used to have some DDS chips in staging but looks like they all got dropped due
to end of time Those had various waveforms and IIRC all we came up with was
descriptive terms + frequencies and magnitudes.

Well they kind of are if you set the magnitude high enough  - but I get your
point.  That's not how they are intended to be used.

I was thinking toggle mode here. This interface doesn't work for dither.
in that case there is just 
out_voltage0_raw for the DC part and
out_voltage0_dither_raw for the dither amplitude.  Assumption being same scaling
as I don't really want to support multiple scale factors if we can avoid it.

So conclusions.. Hmm. Not strong ones yet, but for dither mode at least
I think you want to link particular channels to a TGPx choice

out_voltage0_raw
out_voltage0_raw_available ( nice to have on DACs)
out_voltage0_scale
out_voltage0_dither_raw
out_voltage0_dither_raw_available
out_voltage0_dither_frequency
out_voltage0_dither_frequency_available
out_voltage0_dither_phase
out_voltage0_dither_phase_available

Toggle mode is less clear to me but symbol approach plus TGPx in DT maybe works
You could allow for software override to set the symbol.  Interface to unset
it being to write an empty string to _symbol. Maybe leave that for now.

out_voltage0_raw0
out_voltage0_raw1
out_voltage0_scale
out_voltage0_symbol

Perhaps that's enough for an initial driver and we can think more or complex
corner cases after that is in place?
