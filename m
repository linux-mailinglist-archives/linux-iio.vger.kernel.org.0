+CC William. =20

one thing to note is that a hardware timestamp is just a freerunning
counter.  As such, you can capture it alongside other data in a similar
fashion to any mutliple counter acquisition (which is the same as we
will be doing with this in IIO anyway).

IIO_COUNT might work, but don't use that driver as a basis. It's a leftover
that was complex to clean up that no one has had the time to do yet.

We want to be careful that any meaning we assign to ABI via this driver
doesn't cause legacy problems.

Naming should reflect the channel to which it applies. So add a prefix to
that. Maybe in_countX_falling_edge_active etc (I'm not sure how this
would fit together as a whole ABI however).

A few questions / comments that might help me get my head around this.

There isn't a direct association between a wire and a channel in IIO.
We have various derived channels.  It's more about measuring 'one thing'.

So we could treat these various signals as aspects of a given thing.
Perhaps simply as events (though the interface for those assumes a common
timestamp basis with the host OS).  In that case we'd have 4 events
and every time one fired we'd push an even across to userspace.

Or we treat them as 4 aspects in a 'scan'.  That means we only get
data once all enabled 'edges' are seen, as we push them all together
as 4 channels.  Those channels contain the 4 timestamps from one
sequence of 0,1,2,3.  Either could be abstract counts, or could be
4 timestamps.

I'm not really sure which approach would work out better.

Rule of thumb. IIO events are for asynchronous things like threshold crossi=
ng
detections.  Arguably your detections here are in that category, but because
they happen, 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3 etc they also look like channel scans - where
we normally pretend they are simultaneous measurements of different signals.
They are rarely actually simultaneous as normally there is a mux involved
somewhere and they channels are sampled sequentially and when a scan is fin=
ished
the hardware may well immediately start on the next one.

It may take us a few more iterations to come to a conclusion and even if
the counter subsystem is looking unlikely I'd still like William's input
on this even if it ends up in IIO.  He spent quite some time hammering
odd devices into IIO before there was a counter subsystem.

Thanks,

Jonathan
