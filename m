I agree with you that the choice behind GIGA/NANO can be a bit
confusing.

In my opinion, these defines makes the code easier to read if you
consider them as multipliers with no physical meaning, basically a
pretty name for a power of 10.

By this logic, we wouldn't ever use FEMTO to DECI.

Cheers,
Liam
