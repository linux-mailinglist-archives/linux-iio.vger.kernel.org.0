Hi Jonathan,

I've spent some time on this and mostly reworked things, thanks a lot for
your feedback, it's been quite interesting to learn about IIO. :)

Quite a few of the channels fit well into the (adc_code + offset) * scale format,
however the one you commented on "rradc_post_process_chg_temp()" doesn't seem to
fit, it requires multiple steps of applying offsets and scale and I haven't been
able to re-arrange it to work sensibly.

I noticed the calibbias properties which seems like something I should expose
for "rradc_get_fab_coeff()"?

Could you point me in the right direction here? For reference my WIP tree can be
found here: https://github.com/aospm/linux/commits/upstreaming/spmi-rradc

I also tried switching to labels, but I found that when I drop the extend_name
property the driver fails to probe because multiple channels end up with the same
name in sysfs (e.g. "in_temp_raw"). I've read through the docs and looked at a few
other drivers but I wasn't able to find out what I'm missing for this to work.

I've snipped to the relevant bits below.

Kind regards,
Caleb
