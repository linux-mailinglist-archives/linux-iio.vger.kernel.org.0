Thanks!

So, it's all about cs_change, right?
But doesn't bulk operation work exactly as we need here?

Looking again to the RFC code, it seems like we can still do it

First, you call _gather_write() followed by _read(). It will show exactly what
you do, i.e. you send command first with the value 0x0000, followed by sending
command and reading back the value at the same time.

Would it work?

No, this is about consistency and common sense. If you define type uXX,
we have an API for that exact type. It's confusing why POD type APIs
are used with fixed-width types or vise versa.

Moreover (which is pure theoretical, though) some architectures might
have no (mutual) equivalency between these types.

Yeah, you are right, but it would be still better since it narrows
the problem to the CCF calls only.
