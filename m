not that it really matters for this discussion, but meh - I know where
to look :)

/**
 * IIO_EVENT_CODE() - create event identifier
 * @chan_type:	Type of the channel. Should be one of enum iio_chan_type.
 * @diff:	Whether the event is for an differential channel or not.
 * @modifier:	Modifier for the channel. Should be one of enum iio_modifier.
 * @direction:	Direction of the event. One of enum iio_event_direction.
 * @type:	Type of the event. Should be one of enum iio_event_type.
 * @chan:	Channel number for non-differential channels.
 * @chan1:	First channel number for differential channels.
 * @chan2:	Second channel number for differential channels.
 */
#define IIO_EVENT_CODE(chan_type, diff, modifier, direction,		\
		       type, chan, chan1, chan2)			\
	(((u64)type << 56) | ((u64)diff << 55) |			\
	 ((u64)direction << 48) | ((u64)modifier << 40) |		\
	 ((u64)chan_type << 32) | (((u16)chan2) << 16) | ((u16)chan1) | \
	 ((u16)chan))

I'd forgotten the odd chan vs chan1 bit :)

Otherwise, key thing is we are running out of space in the 64 bits that
are pushed through the event kfifo.

The i and q are ABI already, so we are stuck with them if we want to maintain
consistency.

Ah good point.  Paul's stuff was to allow userspace to basically skip these
fields which in this case would be bad...

extended info is the best plan for now. We can always change that over to
a more standard option at a later date it turns out to be necessary.
