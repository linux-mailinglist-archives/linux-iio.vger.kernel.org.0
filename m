You don't need a second driver to support two different values for
max-brightness. The same driver can support both ranges with nothing but
a small tweak during the driver probe function.

What for?

All the other backlight drivers (there are >130 of them) expose the hardware
range[1]. Most userspaces will already know how to handle that (by reading
the max_brightness and, if it is recent enough, also the scale
properties in sysfs).

I'm still don't understand why one should fix a bug in the userspace by
implementing a hack in the driver.


[1] Well almost. The PWM backlight driver does contain support for
    dead-spot avoidance and to allow the adoption of exponential scale.
    However this  purpose of these is based on how PWM backlights work

Not really.

It's still misleading a sophisticated userspace, which may make bad
rounding decisions for backlight animation, in order to support a broken
one.

As above, ignoring the max_brightness property is a bug in the
userspace. I'm still unclear why sending faked ranges to userspace
it a better solution than fixing the userspace.
