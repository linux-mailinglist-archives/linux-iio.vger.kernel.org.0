Hi Jagath,

This ABI is definitely something I want more eyes than ours on, so
whatever happens I'll leave it on the list for a few weeks.

I wonder if we should list a direction?  As in smaller is more sensitive?
(at least to first approximation)
That way a user would at least be able to consistently decide if they should
raise or lower the number to get the perf the want.

I'm not sure this naming is intuitive enough. Might be a simple
as doubletap_tap2_min_delay?  My brain didn't parse 2min correctly.

This one is a bit odd, so definitely want to hear more view points on whether
this is general enough to cover sensors and intuitive enough that people
have some hope of setting it right.

Needs to be associated with 'tap' in the naming.
Easiest is probably only to define it as
singletap_maxtomin_time + doubletap_maxtomin_time and not have the
shared version as we'd lose the 'tap' part of the name.
