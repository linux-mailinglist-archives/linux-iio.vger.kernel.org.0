Hi Andy, thanks for review

It's reported in the bindings document, I can copy it here

I got the same feeling but at the same time SUNRISE_006_0_0007 seems a
bit too long. Would you suggest to go for that one ? Should I also
rename the .c file accordingly ?

If I place myself in the perspective of someone interested in
verifying support for this chip in linux, I would first be happy I
found a driver for it, then I would even be happier if I got a clear
notice of what features the driver supports and which ones are missing.
Even more so if I look at bindings and find mention of two GPIO lines
which I don't see handled in the driver. A TODO note would make it
clear that those features are missing.

The "make it ready" it's a little bit a non-sense to me, can you count
how many drivers support -all- the features a device provides ? In the
test board I'm using those lines are not even wired, should I throw
around code I cannot even test ?

Ah yes indeed. I got it wrong in so many places in the past !

Do you think it's worth it ?
I admit I never used regmap API so far, but I always got the
impression that for such simple devices it's a bit an overkill. What
benefit would it bring here ?

Ah! Thanks a lot, I missed the fact read_poll_timeout() accepts
a variable number of arguments...
However, the API of the driver i2c read function is:

        int sunrise_read_byte(client, reg, *val);

while read_poll_timeout() expects

        int read(client, reg);

I know the answer already: change your i2c accessor to comply.
As it is only used by read_poll_timeout() I'll do so :)

You know I never saw this syntax before ? :D
I'll use it!

Right!
