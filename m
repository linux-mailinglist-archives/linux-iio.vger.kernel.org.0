Probably better to add them with a comment for platforms on which they
apply (either in commit log or alongside the definitions in the code).

Longer term we should think about whether the code can be adjusted
to not need an explicit definition for these multi purpose channels
though letting the dt itself describe them (under constraints of the
hardware platform).  Not worth doing before this patch though.

It would definitely be nice as an option.  Can't do it every time because
on tree wide change the cc list can become so large the mailing lists
reject it.

Andy Shevchenko has some scripts to try and help with this:
https://github.com/andy-shev/home-bin-tools/blob/master/ge2maintainer.sh

I've not started using them myself (not gotten around to it yet!) but
he's pointed to them when I've missed people from cover letter cc lists
in the past.

In this case I think I can pick this patch up directly into the IIO tree
once everyone else is happy. As you note dts patches normally wait on
knowing the necessary support is heading in.  If you have a view on what
makes sense as the submitter it's good to stick it in the cover letter, but
in this case sounds like you don't. :)

Given we are near the end of this cycle, we are probably looking at next
cycle anyway now, so plenty of time to figure it out!
