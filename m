Agreed. Ever since PRP0001 came in, it's made little to no sense to have
an of_match_ptr() but it's perhaps also not worth the noise of generally
removing 1588 cases of it!

As a side note, of_match_ptr() did make sense, then moving to trickery along the lines
of what was recently done for pm_ptr() to get rid of the need for __maybe_unused
would be good.

#define pm_ptr(_ptr) PTR_IF(IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM), (_ptr))

I 'think' the same trick could be used to make the use of the array visible
to the compiler but still allow it to remove the array. Not actually tried
it though...
