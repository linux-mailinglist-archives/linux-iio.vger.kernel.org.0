IMO, RCU is the wrong word in this context. It provide an advantage
where we need to reuse/read less frequently changed data. In this use
case we need to move data ASAP, so KFIFO seems to work just fine here.

In any case, after implementi double FIFO and more testing I would
prefer to stay with my initial patch. On a single core system, with have
no waiting time at all. No concurrent access. And on the SMP system
(iMX6Q), currently I can measure higher frequency with initial not
optimized driver:
- with counter_push_event() directly from IRQ: max freq 30-35kHz
- with double FIFO, i have max freq of ~25kHz

Your suggestion was to add COUNTER_EVENT_CHANGE_OF_STATE and use it for
my use case. Correct?

Regards,
Oleksij
