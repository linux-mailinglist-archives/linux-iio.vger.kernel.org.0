Great.  Then as expected this separate driver make sense even if the
DT bindings can be combined.  Would be nice if they standardised
the interface, but some companies seem to feel the need to start from
scratch for each device they produce :(

Gah. I was far too sleepy that day.  Glad you interpreted my comment as intended :)

Hmm. You will be relying on the internal implementation of the regmap bus interface
resulting in locks being taken in the i2c controller.  That may be fine, but
it makes me a little nervous that it's relying on a particular implementation.

My normal assumption is that any driver that turns off locking in regmap is doing
so because it has various complex read modify write cycles so needs to have it's
own locks - but that it also applies those locks everywhere regmap would have
done (so for duration of every regmap call).

You may be fine, but you aren't meeting the requirements documented.
The flag to disable locking in regmap states:

 * @disable_locking: This regmap is either protected by external means or
 *                   is guaranteed not to be accessed from multiple threads.
 *                   Don't use any locking mechanisms.

It doesn't say you are fine for simple accesses and there are multiple threads
accessing 'the regmap'.

Unless you really care about it, I'd just leave regmap locking enabled.
The likely performance hit on a device on a slow bus is low and it avoids
us having to think too hard about this.

That's true, but with the addition that it is called in the reverse order of
being add to the devm managed release list.  So ordering matters.

No problem.   As a side note, feel free to just crop out any responses where
you agree with a review.  Default assumption is that if you don't comment that
is the case and it cuts down on scrolling when reviewer next looks.
They are also much more likely to take a look at a short reply than a long one!
