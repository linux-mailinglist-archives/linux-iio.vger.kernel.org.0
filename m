Excellent point.  That documentation is garbage.  Events are meant
to pick it up implicitly from the related channel _raw or _input.
I don't remember them ever having raw or input in their naming but
it's possible they did right at the beginning before the ABI was anywhere
near stable.  Gah. I dread to think how long that that has been wrong.

It doesn't exist really the docs are wrong.

Tricky corner but I'd go with no, because the pattern is

direction_type_infotype

and in this case the infotype is rangeraw. We've not been totally consistent
on whether we allow spaces in infotype or not.  Intially we always did but then
some of the userspace folks asked us to stop doing so because it requires
all userspace software to have an explicit list rather than just adding
controls to some GUI based on generic parsing.  Hohum. Historical decisions that
lead to messy interfaces... *sigh*

Nearest to what you have here though are peak_raw and mean_raw
though those are odd in of themselves in that they are basically special forms
of _raw rather than something else that is in _raw units...

So I think range_raw postfix is the best bet.
