[Answering my own mail]

I got a closer look at counter framework. It is not suitable at all for 
ECAP. Initially, I thought that
"counter_push_event" function could be used, but the only timestamp 
handled by this function
is a software timestamp. I strongly doubt that counter framework 
maintainer would accept
some modification here to support hardware timestamp : a patch rejection 
would be
legitimate, since a counter is dedicated to "event counting". Whereas 
ECAP is dedicated to
"event timestamping".

Beside, ECAP has 4 timestamp registers but they are used to capture 
timestamps for a
single input pin (only 1 channel). In ECAP context, 'index X" is used to 
identify CAP X
(used to capture event X detected on a single pin, with X = 0/1/2/3/0...).
In counter framework, "index X" is used to identify channel X (among 
several pins).
So, the word "index" has not the same meaning in counter framework than 
in ECAP device.
Somehow, this ECAP index (0/1/2/3 for CAP1/2/3/4 registers) must be 
logged with timestamp
because it is an important part of signal info for the user (raw 
consecutive timestamps
are not enough).

So, here is my proposal for my next version :
(1) Replace IIO_INDEX by IIO_COUNT channel (already used in 
"stm32-timer-trigger.c" driver)
# In ECAP documentation, the word "index" is not used. The word used to 
speak about this
0->1->2->3->0 sequenced counter is "Mod4 counter".
(2) Configure event mode with 4 sysfs entries (to remove the mix of 
buffers and events interfaces)
# User will see 4 files (1 file for each CAP timestamp) named 
"falling_edge_active_0/1/2/3".
Writing 1 will select falling edge/ Writing 0 will select rising edge.

Would it be an acceptable alternative for you, Jonathan ? Would either 
(1) and/or (2) be a "no-go" ?
