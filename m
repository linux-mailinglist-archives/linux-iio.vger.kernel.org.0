Yet here I thought that it was clear from previous conversations that
we are not really dealing with a single-ended/pseudo-differential input,
just a differential ADC that can be used in that manner.

We do not have here such a clear cut case as with AD7194, where an input
is dedicated for single-ended/pseudo usage. Here, the inputs are mix and
match and single-ended/pseudo is obtainable with other pins than VINCOM/
ADCIN15.

When configuring channels we are *always* specifying two voltage inputs.
I strongly disagree using single-channel for voltage channels in these
families of ADC's.

It seemed to me that the conclusion that we arrived to was to expose the
precise pins that are used in the conversion and document the selection.

Yes, it is a single-ended channel. So revert to the way it was in V1 using
single-channel?

Not really, so just a bool differential flag? (this seems weird as we have diff-channels)

In the ad411x yes, over to ad717x it's mixed:

I agree that we do not need to differentiate between those two.
But the approach with the supply is too specific, the adi,channel-type
property is not only for AD4116-ADCIN15, but for all models compatible.

In this case there is a 1-1 correspondence between this reg limit and the number
of channel configuration registers available to the device. Maybe another property
then reg? Sure...but this limitation fits the current situation.

In addition, the device does not work the same as ad719x. If I understood correctly
that documentation, the configuration register needs to be rewritten for every different
input combination. This means that the driver is implemented to overwrite the reg for
every read. This device, it seems to me, is more in the liking's of write all the channel
configs at once, then keep using those.

For AD719x yes, it is artificial. Over here we have a clear reason.
