Please do. Also please add a fixes tag given we are treating it
as a fix.  If we discover someone is using the num variant then
we'll just have to support both values as a fix to the fix.
Not ideal, but as observed, hopefully people are validating the
DTs (which basically means no one is using this in production or
it would have been pointed out before).
