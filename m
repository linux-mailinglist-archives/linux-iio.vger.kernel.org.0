Hello,

As part of a previous discussion with Jonathan (I know, it was three
months ago, sorry for the delay :-$), it appeared necessary to do a
little bit of cleanup in the IIO core and at least provide a little bit
more documentation for developers diving into the IIO subsystem for the
first time. My first move was to write a blog post trying to explain
(from my point of view but with the review of Jonathan) what is
necessary to understand when writing and IIO kernel driver:
https://bootlin.com/blog/the-backbone-of-a-linux-industrial-i-o-driver/

Here is now the second halve of this work, with few things that I tried
to address.

* The currentmode indio_dev entry was misused by several device drivers,
  I tried to understand which ones were wrong (there are two still
  accessing this variable left, I decided not to touch them because I
  think it is legitimate) and I tried to find an alternative.

* Then, I tried to make new accesses to this variable harder in order to
  avoid future mistakes, by creating a helper to read it from outside the
  core and moving it to the opaque structure.

* I continued with the IIO modes which are completely
  undocumented. Following a few exchanges with Jonathan, I tried to take
  most of this discussion and put it into a kernel doc header.

* When doing the above task, I realized that there was a particular case
  handled for kfifo buffers which I tried to simplify, but if this is a
  mistake, I'll just drop the patch.

Hope this will help!

Cheers,
MiquÃ¨l

Changes in v3:
* Added a patch to cleanup the _write_raw() callbacks in the st_sensor
  drivers. Returned as early as possible.
* Updated the description of INDIO_DIRECT_MODE and INDIO_BUFFER_SOFTWARE
  as discussed.
* Added the R-by from Fabrice.
* Extended the coverage of the odr lock in order to avoid relying on the
  iio_device_claim_direct_mode() helper implementation for that.

Changes in v2:
* Added Alexandru Reviewed-by when relevant.
* Indicated that "modes" is a bitmask as suggested.
* Added a mention in the "modes" kdoc about the function that could
  alter its content in the core.
* Added more driver maintainers in Cc.
* Avoided deleting the INDIO_BUFFER_TRIGGERED mode from kfifos.
* Dropped entirely the currentmode setter helper.
* Avoided using the currentmode getter from places where we have access
  to the opaque structure (ie. from the core itself).
* Added a patch to move the iio_buffer_enabled() definition in the core
  as it cannot be inlined anymore.
* Dropped completely the use of the mlock lock form the st-sensor
  drivers by inserting an additional local lock when this was
  needed. Hopefully I didn't fail that, this will need testing.
* Reworded the modes kdoc as advised by Jonathan.
