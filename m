Either way, not getting sleep at night is rarely amusing. :/ Sometimes

I took a quick look at this. So, changing the "power-mode" enum enables 
doing the not-so-standard changes.

Thank you for the ideas. Adding a entry to enable 'not standard 
settings' definitely sounds like a way to explore. I think I'll return 
to this later :)

Sorry. I did not really manage to explain it too well.

Basically, I just further pondered handling the the case where:
- a requested change of channel #A scale could not be done purely by 
changing the gain but would require an integration time change.
AND
- the channel #B gain change caused by integration time change could not 
be compensated by changing #B hardwaregain.

I was just saying that allowing this channel #A scale change even though 
it would also impact the scale of channel #B would probably be Ok for 
many users. I think that a few of the users could be prepared for other 
channels to change as well, and go read back all channels' scales after 
changing one.

Then I was further speculating that there might be cases where channel 
#A data and channel #B data were consumed by different applications. It 
was all just speculation. For example, the original BU27034 had two 
channels for visible light and one for IR. So I built an imaginary 
device which ran two different user applications, one interested on 
visible light for darkening my sunglasses and the other interested on IR 
channel and then toggling the cooling fan to keep my vacation drinks at 
optimum temperature. :)

Here, if the sunglasses application changing the scale for visible light 
caused also the scale of the IR channel to change, my fan-application 
would unexpectedly start pick up differently scaled values and the 
temperature of my drinks would be all wrong.

Agreed. It's nice someone drops me back on earth when I start drifting 
too far :) Thanks!

I appreciate your insight on how people usually use these devices :) 
It's very valuable to me.

Yes. I think some users will eventually hit to a scale transition which 
will be NACKed by the driver. Also, I don't think this problem will be 
specific to the BU27034 sensor, but in some form this will be possible 
for many gain-time-scale type devices. I just don't have a good generic 
solution in my mind right now.

Oh, besides, it seems raining stopped. Time to turn off my computer and 
go out to the yard :)
