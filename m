Ahh got it... May failure was not realizing that iio_scan_mask_match() retu=
rns
the available masks so I was assuming that the bitmap_equal() check would o=
nly
differ when multiple buffers are enabled.

Oh well, I think then this should work... I'm not sure it will be more
performant for the case where we don't enable all the channels because the =
demux
is a linked list which is far from being a performance friend (maybe we can=
 do
some trials with something like xarray...). Still, for this to work the buf=
fer
we pass into IIO has to be bigger than it needs to be (so bigger memset())
because, AFAIU, we will have to pass on all the scan elements and, as I sai=
d,
the burst data will either have delta or normal measurements (not both). I =
guess
the code will still look simpler so if there's no visible difference in
performance I'm fine with the change. I guess Ramona can give it a try to s=
ee
how it looks like.
