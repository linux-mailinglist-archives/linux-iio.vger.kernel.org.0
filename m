Since this is a runtime thing, it doesn't make sense to have a property
that is set at dts creation time that decides what mode the pin is in.

Hmm, at the risk of getting out of my depth with what the GPIO subsystem
is capable of doing, I would expect to see something like

sampling-rate-gpios:
  description:
    <what you have above>
  maxItems: 1

Which would allow the driver to either drive this pin via the gpio
subsystem, or to use the interrupt property to use it as an interrupt
instead.

Perhaps Jonathan etc knows better for these sort of dual mode pins.

Conor.
