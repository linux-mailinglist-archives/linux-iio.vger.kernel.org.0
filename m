I do not see where the restriction appears when using just the flag, when defining
the channels you would still define unique reg values.

So a channel without diff-channels defined and reg=16 means IN0+ IN0-?

Then this would need to be done to any fully differential ADC as support
for pseudo differential channels is present (connect a fixed non 0 voltage
to the negative input).

The AD717x family supports pseudo differential channels as well... should
this change be applied to them too? It is just the case that the documentation
does not mentions this use case.

I think that a distinction needs to be made here:
- When a device is only pseudo differential, sure, it is in a different category
- When a device is fully differential and you are using it as pseudo-differential
  you are having two inputs compared to one another

I would need more clarification is why would supply-vincom be a requirement.
The voltage supplied to VINCOM will not be used in any computation within 
the driver. From the perspective of getting the data it doesn't matter if 
you are using the channel in a pseudo-differential, single ended or fully
differential manner.

Regarding VINX VINX+1, it is not mandatory to respect those, from AD4111 page27:
"Due to the matching resistors on the analog front end, the
 differential inputs must be paired together in the following
 pairs: VIN0 and VIN1, VIN2 and VIN3, VIN4 and VIN5, and
 VIN6 and VIN7. If any two voltage inputs are paired in a
 configuration other than what is described in this data sheet,
 the accuracy of the device cannot be guaranteed."

Tried the device and it works as fully differential when pairing any
VINx with VINCOM. Still works when selecting VINCOM as the positive
input of the ADC.

I really see this as overly complicated and unnecessary. These families
of ADCs are fully differential. If you are using it to measure a single ended
(Be it compared to 0V or pseudo differential where you are comparing to Vref/2
and obtaining results [Vref/2 , -Vref/2]) the final result will not require knowing
the common voltage.
