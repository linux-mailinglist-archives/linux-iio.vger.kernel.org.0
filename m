Yes.  Just somewhere other than /dev because I agree that feels wrong.

Agreed - this does rely on that wildcard.

Agreed they have changed in the past. Mostly a case of fixing up
devices that didn't have their parents set (there are lots of those left
- that reminds me that I was cleaning up perf drivers that do this wrong
last year and only got part way through it :(

We will keep the /sys/bus/iio/devices/ path the same and continue to
support all paths below there (there are already compatibility links
in place for buffers for example from when we added multiple buffer support).
However, sysfs docs are pretty blunt on not relying on reliable paths for
classes (and the IIO bus is effectively a class from this point of view).

Good luck.  If you have time it might be good to hear what you end up
with!
