Usual solution is just to add that name to a per device type structure.
In this particular case there isn't one so far though and an enum is used
in the one place we might otherwise have used a part number specific struct=
ure.

Probably the easiest thing to do is use the enum to do a lookup in an array
of structures and have the string there.

Should be part number.  Instances are distinguished via label rather than
name (or via the device parent on older kernels where we didn't have
label).

There are a few places where we accidentally let though IDs that aren't
always simply the part number and they became part of the ABI so we
couldn't really fix them after the event.
