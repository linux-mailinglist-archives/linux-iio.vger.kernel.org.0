That's interesting to hear.  I wonder why - the overhead should be small.

Potentially it kicks the interrupt thread which then might kick an spi
controller thread rather than kicking the spi controller directly.
I think that depends on the SPI controller driver implementation choices
assuming things aren't contended - the defaults in the spi core
will take a fast path in current context if no contention - so it'll
happen in the interrupt thread.  So in general case there should be
very little difference in the timing needed to kick off the actual
SPI transfer starting via the two paths. The bit you mention below
on overlapping is a gain.  One trick we do to try and grab that back
if it's occasional is to poll the device in the trigger reenable
callback (only works if there is a register to say there is new data).

Maybe something odd going on in the interrupt controller driver...
It might not be useable for the higher frequencies, but should work
at reasonably low ones.

I'd be surprised if the processing time was significant (compared to the SPI
transfer times) - so this 'feels' like a bit of over the top micro
optimization.

If you are running anywhere near speeds where this happens, things aren't
going to be reliable anyway. Whether that is a problem depends on your usecase.

So in conclusion, I'm surprised you are seeing such a difference in the
rates you can capture at.  Might be worth trying to grab some debug info
to understand this a bit more given you are proposing an unusual structure
with maintenance costs etc.

Don't bother :)  Better to crop as much as possible. We have archives for
history.
