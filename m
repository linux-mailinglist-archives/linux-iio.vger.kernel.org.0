I didn't know those actually landed upstream (or I didn't remember), I
was waiting on the SW_LAP_PROXIMITY input device method to land:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon/-/merge_requests/42

That's abandoned, right?

OK, good to know.

I've filed:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/iio-sensor-proxy/-/issues/321
so we can eventually export more than a single proximity sensor through
the D-Bus interface in the future.
