If we are in a static configuration (see below) then just don't expose the
software toggle control.  Not having a big red button to press is the best way to
tell userspace to not press the big red button...

I'd agree if there was one to one mapping from TGPx to channel.  Given
it's highly configurable, they 'might' want to set the mapping differently
at runtime.  I'm fine if we don't support that option until someone asks
though.
