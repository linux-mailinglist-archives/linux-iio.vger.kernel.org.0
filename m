Hi Matti,

I think this is coming together nicely. A few comments inline.

Why?  Doesn't look hard to support just one or the other?
Normally we only do this sort of limitation when there is a heavily
optimized read routine for a set of channels and it is better
to grab them all and throw away the ones we don't care about.
That doesn't seem to be true here. So if the fifo grabbed both
temp and pressure it would makes sense here, but doesn't seem
like it does.

IIO_VAL_FRACTIONAL?  Mind you I'm not sure that will result in enough precision
either here.   For in kernel use it will have full precision though as will be
kept as a fraction.  I guess question of whether it is worse than what you have
here.  There hasn't been much demand for IIO_VAL_INTO_PLUS_PICO, but if we have
to look at that we can - with proviso that existing userspace software won't know
anything about it.

Comment doesn't seem to have much to do with code that follows it?
Maybe needs more detail given you clearly access the IC before reading
FIFO_LVL.

That irq disable is potentially expensive.
Why not just pass the current timestamp into the __bm1390_fifo_flush?

The locks should prevent other races I think..

I don't want to see garbage (or a zero :) pushed into the buffer. So
if you get a read fail, don't push to buffers.

Nice case for the new guard() calls which do automatic release of locks
on exit from a function - we also have scoped_guard for stuff inside
functions.

Here it will let you use direct returns throughout as lock will always
be released for you.

Matter of taste, so I won't argue strongly but I'd prefer to see this
check at the call site, not down in the function.  Makes the flow more
obvious and we don't have usual reasons for doing it this way
(either too much indenting at the call site, or lots of similar calls).

Why doesn't this still apply even if we don't have an irq for this device?
Can use a sysfs or hrtimer trigger or an irq on another device.

Mixing trigger and buffer stuff in here. I'd rather see them
separate - so move this up to where you set the buffer up.

Check the allocation.  Definitely don't want name not defined here.

Given it's unconditionally set and no line length issue, I'd prefer this
done on the local variable definitions block above.

Why this ordering?  I'd expect this either:
1) Immediately after it becomes available so above the regulator enable,
or
2) immediately before it is used, so a few lines down above data->regmap...
Here it just looks a bit lost :)
