Dearest beloved in the Lord,

I am Ms. Alice Johnson, a 75 year old British woman. I was born an orphan
and GOD blessed me abundantly with riches but no children nor husband which
makes me an unhappy woman. Now I am affected with cancer of the lung and
breast with a partial stroke which has affected my speech. I can no longer
talk well and half of my body is paralyzed, I sent this email to you with
the help of my private female nurse.

My condition is really deteriorating day by day and it is really giving me
lots to think about.  This has prompted my decision to donate all I have
for charity; I have made numerous donations all over the world. After going
through your profile, I decided to make my last donation of Ten Million
Five Hundred Thousand United Kingdom Pounds  (UK=C2=A310.500, 000, 00) to y=
ou as
my investment manager. I want you to build an Orphanage home with my name (
Alice Johnson ) in your country.

If you are willing and able to do this task for the sake of humanity then
send me below information for more details to receive the funds.

1. Name...................................................

2. Phone number...............................

3. Address.............................................

4. Country of Origin and residence

Ms.  Alice Johnson .
