Hi Caleb / All

Rather than waste time going for a v15 for the 3 minor issues in reviews
I've just fixed them up whilst applying.

As spmi or mfd maintainers may want an immutable branch I've
just pushed one out at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jic23/iio.git immutable-qcom-spmi-rradc
that has the first 5 patches. I assume the dts changes will go via qcom -> arm-soc
as normal.

0-day should run on that branch shortly but I'll be optimistic and pull it
into my testing branch in the meantime (mostly so I don't forget about it and
can mark it applied in patchwork :)

Thanks,

Jonathan
