You've lost me.  It's a pin that has a state change when an error condition
occurs.  Why not an interrupt?  Doesn't matter that the driver doesn't
use this functionality. dt-bindings should be as comprehensive as possible.
Given it's a multipurpose pin you'd also want to support it as a gpio to be
complete alongside the other GPIOs.

SPI_READY is supported by only a couple of controllers. I'm not even that
sure exactly how it is defined and whether that lines up with this usecase.

Flow control: Ready Sequence
Master CS   |-----1\_______________________|
Slave  FC   |--------2\____________________|
DATA        |-----------3\_________________|

So you set master and then wait for a flow control pin (the ready signal) b=
efore
you can actually talk to the device.

Here we are indicating data is ready to be be read out.

So I don't 'think' SPI_READY applies.
