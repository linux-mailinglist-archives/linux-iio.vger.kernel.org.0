The corner I'm not clear on is what we do if for example all TGPx pins are
specified in DT.  Is the mapping from channel to TGPx things in toggle mode
always a function of the external circuit or do we want to make it runtime
controllable?

I'm absolutely fine if we just make it a dt property - particularly
as those TGPx pins may well not be visible to the host processor.

We probably do want to provide some options in dt for what they might be
connnected to on the host.  I'm guessing potentially a gpio, or a clk?

You could also wire them to a non general purpose output pin - but that
would be really hard to describe in a generic fashion.

My guess was as that in toggle mode at least, LDAC would update the DACs to
reflect the 'current' toggle registers, but I'm not totally sure.

Agreed, though note that we could ensure we always were in one of these modes
if it made sense from software point of view.

There are different ways you could use this facility if you assume the TGPx pins
are wired to the host processor rather than something out of our control.

You could use it for double buffering for example - so update INPUT_B, then toggle,
update INPUT_A then toggle etc.
Or you could assume it's for mass mode switching - so there are only two values
that will ever be set and these reflect something in the external circuits. We
might not even have software control / visibility of which state is active.

Does seem unlikely for dither mode as you'd need a huge amount of bus traffic
to basically provide a bad clock signal.  Toggle I can also sort of see
being useful with sw_toggle - but suspect real usecase for that is the one
where the host processor isn't controlling the toggle..

It may well make sense to only implement a subset but it is often useful
to walk through what a more sophisticated feature set might look like
as then we don't accidentally rule it out.

As long as it's a simple factor, just hit it with a 'small adjusting tool'
until it does have the same scaling.  We do that in a few similar cases
IIRC as sometimes things like this dither input have lower resolution.

If it's the same scaling then you won't have to hit it at all ;)

No, I mean providing the read_avail() callback and setting
BIT(IIO_INFO_RAW) in info_mask_separate_available

That's how we provide range for a channel except in some unusual
corner cases and the internal interface for that is used when a DAC
is being used via the consumer interface (so some other driver wants
to set it's output).

Certainly possible.  Nice to avoid if we can, but not if it means stretching
things too far.

I'll go with 'maybe' for these.  The use for changing things doesn't make sense to me
unless we have multiple things to change at once.  If it's just the frequency it
would be more intuitive to have a write to that attribute do the disable, set value
and enable dithering again without needing to do a dance with the interface.

I'm not sure when updating needs to be done atomically across the various variables (so
would need to be done under a single disable / enable sequence.
