I'd be cynical and for initial version at least, just hide it as 'too
complex' with a comment in the driver code on why.

If they don't have meaning then they should disappear, but it would
also be valid to have the 'broken' one be read only if there is
an appropriate value.

Sounds sensible - but.... Make sure you check the firmware version
number (I hope it has one) and print a warning at least if you get
one that you have strong reason to believe will handle this differently
from whatever the driver is supporting.

This is definitely going to be a case for detailed comments in
the driver code so that we can 'recall' what on earth was
going on here in N years time!
