Beyond them being a pain? The fun is they may get wired to interrupt
controllers that are also GPIOs or they may not (and the other way around
with them wired to GPIO pins that aren't interrupt pins).

I don't understand the usecase for the SLOW control.
Given it seems software can override the use for SLOW I'd be tempted to
always do that.=20
Thus making this pin useable only as an optional interrupt.

If someone hard wires it to high or low that is harmless if we aren't
letting it control anything.
