Andy is requesting something different here by asking for a local
struct device *dev = sunrise->client->dev;

but personally I wouldn't bother when there is only one use in a given
function. I wouldn't mind if you did do it either - this one is very much
personal taste and so I tend to not worry about it!

Having the extra pointer in iio_priv() was a case of architecture being
a bit 'fuzzy' for convenience which is a different matter.

one of the checking scripts tends to moan about this so it's nice to clean it
out at the start and avoid the inevitable follow up patch :)

Part of the issue here is that the naming perhaps suggests a hardware rad
whereas it's just a bit of string handling.

Whilst it's shared code, there is only a rather tangential connection between
the two call sites and the function itself ended up a bit weird.

I'd go with what Andy is suggesting and just have this handling inline.
