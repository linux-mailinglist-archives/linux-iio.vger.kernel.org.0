Yeah, I've started that process last week:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/20230804145342.1600136-1-nuno.sa@analog.c=
om/

the dac counterpart is actually missing in the RFC (as the goal of the RFC =
is
not review those drivers but the framework) but I do state that my plan is =
to
have it in the actual series where I actually mention we would need this wo=
rk
:).
