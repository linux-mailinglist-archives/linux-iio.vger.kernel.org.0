Agreed - the explanation of 'why' is needed.
As discussed, in this case the end consumer is iio-hwmon
(reflecting that the thing we are ultimately 'measuring' as a voltage
 of a wire that needs monitoring for hwmon usecases) and
that is measured via a voltage divider (hence that's providing
the measurement service) which in turn needs to consume the reading
from and ADC and hence the middle device is here acting as a
provider to iio-hwmon and a consumer of the ADC channel.

p.s. No one really likes the iio-hwmon binding because it is reflecting
     a usecase rather than hardware, but meh, it's been around a long time
     and we never figured out a better option.

    Things are much cleaner for circuits like the voltage divider.

Given this device fits in both categories, perhaps a tiny bit of
additional documentation would help?

  '#io-channels-cells':
    description:
      In addition to consuming the measurement services of an ADC,
      the voltage divider can act as an provider of measurement
      services to other devices.
