ok.  I don't like lack of range clamping - so at the point of the caller
I can't immediately see that these will be sub 16bit value.  Not htat
important I guess.

A struct or array + enum would work. 
I just don't much like lots of very similar parameters.

This isn't particularly important either way.  My gut would have
been to keep them as __le16 to the point where the maths happens
but I don't mind it happening elsewhere.

I do want different names though given the inputs and outputs are
different 'things'.

Either is fine.  Just don't like the scaling from different sides of
the variable.  I can see how you got there from 0.18 * Green but equally
valid to premultiply by 100 as it is to post multiply (when doing the
maths on paper).
