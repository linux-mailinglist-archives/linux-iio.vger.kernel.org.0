If you are using bursts, the data is getting read anyway - which is the main
cost here. The real question becomes what are you actually saving by suppor=
ting all
the combinations of the the two subsets of channels in the pollfunc?
Currently you have to pick the channels out and repack them, if pushing the=
m all
looks to me like a mempcy and a single value being set (unconditionally).

Then it's a question of what the overhead of the channel demux in the core =
is.
What you pass out of the driver via iio_push_to_buffers*()
is not what ends up in the buffer if you allow the IIO core to do data demu=
xing
for you - that is enabled by providing available_scan_masks.  At buffer
start up the demux code computes a fairly optimal set of copies to repack
the incoming data to match with what channels the consumer (here probably
the kfifo on the way to userspace) is expecting.

That demux adds a small overhead but it should be small as long
as the channels wanted aren't pathological (i.e. every other one).

Advantage is the driver ends up simpler and in the common case of turn
on all the channels (why else did you buy a device with those measurements
if you didn't want them!) the demux is zerocopy so effectively free which
is not going to be the case for the bitmap walk and element copy in the
driver.
