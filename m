Oddly I thought I replied to this before lunch, but not seeing my own message.
My understanding is that any device that trashes it's own buffers during
DMA is broken and needs to implement bounce buffers within the SPI master
driver.  That shouldn't happen anyway because the race conditions around
this are about caching and stale data write back. During a transfer, only
the device should touch the cacheline with the DMA buffers in it, so any
write back that might return stale data should be pushing back the correct
data (unchanged) or data the device wants to update..

My suggestion is an expanded comment (I'm fine adding this whilst applying
and fixing the docs version numbering highlighted above). The key here
is that we don't have one bit of the code changing the buffers whilst
DMA is in progress via a different path.  They all need to be covered
by the same lock.

	 * DMA (thus cache coherency maintenance) requires any
	 * transfer buffers to live in their own cache lines.
	 * As the use of these buffers is synchronous, all of the
	 * buffers used for DMA in this driver may share a cache
	 * line.

Note I'm waiting on a DT review though before taking this. Complex
binding but I see it's in their patchwork as needs review so hopefully
they'll get to it soon.
