Usual thing is to use the and similar phrasing for the title if it
is getting to long and have the one place that lists them all being the belp
text.  We need it somewhere so people can grep for it.

I wasn't that clear on exactly where to do that!  Sorry about that.

I'm not totally sure what Andy is suggesting with his feedback here.

You could use a function pointer in the cfg structure and provide appropriate read
functions for the different types so that read_raw() can call the appropriate function
for the type of device.  That would be tidy and avoid this need to change
to an enum.

Sorry for slow response btw as I didn't get in before v3!

Thanks,
