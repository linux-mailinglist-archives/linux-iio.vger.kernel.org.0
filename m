That is referring to the fact that you can't start the buffer if it
doesn't match (because we can't mess with the data stream in
that type of buffer as we don't necessarily see it in software!)

Yup. That should work.  But in this case you can trivially decide not to read
or fill in the temperature and hence save some bus cycles.

You need to pack the data correctly yourself in the driver.
So it adds small amount of code complexity but potentially saves bus
traffic.

Yes.  If you don't tell it what channel setups are available (note there can
be lots) you are saying that we support any random combination and have
to do the data packing by hand.

Hmm. That is a good reason to keep the available scan masks set.
Add a comment on that next to the mask.

Makes sense given need to read the pressure channel.

active_scan_mask should match the above - it's separate from what is enabled.
active_scan_mask is on the data capture side of the demux - the buffers
are then fed repacked data reflecting what is enabled.
