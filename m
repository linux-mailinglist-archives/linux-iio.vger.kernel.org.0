Anyway, thanks for review! My answers below.

How? Technically as I mentioned currently it's the case to use
only the date from fraction. The bigger object would be needed
in case of using data that is not fraction. Either way it would
be easy to add a container_of() than supply unneeded data to
the method.

TL;DR: It makes possible not to mix bananas with wooden boxes.

I understand your point. I will provide a mult_fract() macro and
apply it to AFE to show the usability of this. Would it work better?

I haven't checked the other possible improvements based on new type, but
I truly believe that the types themselves are good to have.

UAPI is another story. It might be possible to extend, but I would like
to avoid expanding the proposed types to UAPI (we don't have many users
and I believe they more or less unique, so v4l2 is rather exception than
usual).
