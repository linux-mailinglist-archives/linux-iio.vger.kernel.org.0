Thank You for the patience and the explanation Jonathan. I have a - 
hopefully not totally wrong - feeling I understand this better. I didn't 
understand that IIO framework has this extra logic and that 
available_scan_masks was not really meant for telling what IIO allows 
_users_ to enable - but it was for driver to tell IIO core what the 
driver can give. (Naturally this impacts to what IIO allows users to 
enable, but not directly). Eg, if I now get it right, the 
'available_scan_masks' is information what data flows between driver and 
IIO. Similarly, 'active_scan_mask' tells what the IIO core 'expects' to 
get from the driver, right? So, in bm1390 case, if I set both:

BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE) | BIT(BM1390_CHAN_TEMP),
and
BIT(BM1390_CHAN_PRESSURE),

to 'available_scan_masks', then it means driver is telling IIO it can 
give both pressure and temperature, or temperature alone. As a result, 
IIO can set either both temp and pressure to 'active_scan_mask' - in 
which case driver should push both in the buffers - or just the 
pressure, in which case the driver should not push the temperature.

Okay... I think it kind of makes sense to leave an option where the 
driver can create buffer as it wants. I am not sure I can wrap my head 
around this to the extent that I knew when the IIO does not know what 
channels the driver has enabled - and thus, what types of data there 
will be - but I can accept the answer that such situations can exist :) 
Besides, allowing the driver to do the buffer formatting may allow some 
'use-case specific, custom optimizations' when user-space knows what to 
expect (for example, regarding the data alignments and ordering to for 
example save space).

...This leads to another thing I noticed - and to another question :)

I was experimenting with the bm1390 scan masks and iio_generic_buffer 
tool. It seems to me that the iio_generic_buffer does not expect the 
padding when the data in buffer is u32 + u16. When I enable the pressure 
(32bits) and temperature (16 bits) in bm1390 and keep the time-stamp 
disabled, the user-space will get buffer where 2 bytes of padding is 
added to each temperature sample so the next pressure sample stays 
correctly aligned. I believe kernel side does sane job here.

This, however, did result (at least my version of) the 
iio_generic_buffer tool to read garbage values after the first sample. 
My assumption is that the iio_generic_buffer does not add the padding 
bytes to the end of last data in the scan in order to ensure also the 
next scan will be correctly aligned.

I did following change to the iio_generic_buffer:

Author: Matti Vaittinen <mazziesaccount@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 21 10:15:19 2023 +0300

     tools: iio: iio_generic_buffer ensure alignment

     The iio_generic_buffer can return garbage values when the total size of
     scan data is not a multiple of largest element in the scan. This can be
     demonstrated by reading a scan consisting for example of one 4 byte and
     one 2 byte element, where the 4 byte elemnt is first in the buffer.

     The IIO generic buffert code does not take into accunt the last two
     padding bytes that are needed to ensure that the 4byte data for next
     scan is correctly aligned.

     Add padding bytes required to align the next sample into the scan size.

Cool! So, the driver can rely on IIO asking for the pressure (in 
active_scan_mask) after it has correctly set the available scan mask. It 
may not be a big thing but I like it. It is enough to take care of 
ensuring all required stuff is read from HW in one place (in available 
scan masks) and not to worry about it in actual data reading path but 
just read stuff IIO is asking to be read. I like it.

Another thing to note is that, when we build the available_scan_mask 
array - we should either pay attention to the order of masks - or change 
the iio_scan_mask_match() to not accept first matching subset but to go 
through all of the masks unless it finds and exactly matching one (and 
in general prefer the smallest subset). Not sure this is worth the extra 
cycles though.

Thanks again - feel like I've learned something today :)
