No problem. We are all getting used to how to use this stuff. There
have been a few 'comments' from Linus Torvalds on people doing it wrong.
One of those (it was about cond_guard() proposal if you want to find it)
is applicable here (note that Linus was rather abrupt in that thread and
got called out for it, not in my view a good example of kernel process).

Make more use of helper functions to avoid gotos.

... to here out as a separate little function - somethimg like
bmp280_read_raw_impl() which can use guard() and direct returns
internally.

Then this block will be

	pm_runtime_get_sync_data(data->dev);
	ret = bmp280_read_raw_impl(...);
	pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(data->dev);
	pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(data->dev);

	return ret;

This inverts ordering of pm and the guard mutex, so not a good idea.

Don't try that approach - it's complexity that will get a response
you don't want from Linus.  Helper functions solve this one
for us nicely.

At somepoint maybe generic infrastructure for runtime pm handling
will be added, but that stuff is complex enough already so I suspect
not or not until people are in general much more confident with the
cleanup.h infrastructure and where it is appropriate.

What you are doing here should all be standard usage at the simpler
end of the scale, so not a risky as a few things I'm trying to get in :)
