Hi David,

Some tricky corners...
3-wire here for example doesn't mean what I at least expected it to.

I hope Nuno + Michael will ack this. Bit mean to drop them in it otherwise
(funny though :)

So 9ns for 3-write and 4-wire, but I think it's 11ns for chained.
Maybe it's not worth constraining that.

there is a standard property in spi-controller.yaml for 3-wire. Does that c=
over
the selection between 3-wire and 4-wire here?  Seems like this might behave
differently from that (and so perhaps we shouldn't use 3-wire as the descri=
ption
to avoid confusion, normally 3-wire is a half duplex link I think).

Chain mode is more fun.  We've had that before and I'm trying to remember w=
hat
the bindings look like. Devices like ad7280a do a different form of chainin=
g.

Anyhow, main thing here is we need to be careful that the terms don't overl=
ap
with other possible interpretations.

I think what this really means is:

3-wire - no chip select, exclusive use of the SPI bus (yuk)
4-write - conventional SPI with CS
chained - the 3 wire mode really but with some timing effects?

Can we figure out if chained is going on at runtime?

I'm a bit lost on this one - but think we can get rid of it in favour of us=
ing
the fact someone wired up the supplies to indicate their intent?

So if neither refin-supply or ref-supply is present then this is the one to=
 use.

So if refin-supply is supplied this is the expected choice?

So if a ref-supply is provided this is expected choice?

If we are going to rule you supplying refin and ref supplies.=20

ah, that's exciting - so in 3-wire mode, we basically put the CS on a diffe=
rent pin...

Mark, perhaps you can suggest how to handle this complex family of spi vari=
ants?
