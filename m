In my case I have a digital filter peripheral (frontend) linked to 
several sigma delta converters (backends). So, here 'converters' 
property may be relevant as well. But I agree that a more generic name 
seems better for the long term.

My backend devices need to get a regulator phandle from the device tree.
It seems that the component API does not offer services allowing to 
retrieve DT properties for the sub-devices. Tell me if I'm wrong, but I 
think this constraint require to change converter framework to a typical 
OF lookup.

Could you please share the structure of your DT for your ad9476 based 
example ? This will help me identify the gaps regarding my need.

Here, we need to clarify some points related to DT first, I think.
I assume that API itself should not be too much a concern.
