Great that I didn't put you off too much and I should have said welcome!
As someone who has a v9 patch set to send out tomorrow (for another area of the kernel),
I'm well aware there can be quite a learning curve.


A few follow up comments below, but mostly guessing what might have made
things trickier rather than anything useful.

It's a slow bus, maybe the delay is above that anyway.

It's a neat bit of code and maybe one day worth considering if we should try to auto
tune, but definitely not something to do in a driver alongside the initial
enablement.

Pretty new + the more complex corners of what can be done are still
controversial.  Thankfully mutexes are a simple case.

Often it's a type issue for interrupts - particularly level vs edge.
Thankfully it's fairly rare to get interrupt controllers that only
do one or the other these days - that used to be really painful to
try and handle in a driver.

It's relatively recent (few years ago) so if you are on an older tree
it might not have been true.
