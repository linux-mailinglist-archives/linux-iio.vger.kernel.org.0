Hi Dmitry,

Feel free to crop replies.  No need to agree with things. Anything
you haven't commented on,  I'll assume you agree with and saves
some time on a big driver like this to not have to go looking
for the questions.

Replies inline.

I think so in this case.

Two big ones are bulk reads and I don't think the field code will optimize
out the read when doing a full register write.

Ok. That's fine then.

If you have non trivial read modify write (i.e. you need to do something
inbetween) then it's fine to have a local lock, but then the comment needs
to make that clear.  State is too vague a comment.

No.  You should not be doing the endian conversion in the buffered
read paths, but do have to do them for the read_raw path because
read_raw can return a mess of different forms of data, (integer,
decimal, fraction and others) so there isn't a single definition of
what endian conversion would even mean for that.

Sounds good.  If we can get there via some initial state then
you may want to make sure we aren't in that mode. (I don't
think that's the case but haven't checked closely).

Hmm. Trying to carry on when you've had a comms failure is always hit
and miss. Often we just assume the state is invalid and that other
stuff might not work after comms has broken once.

If you want to paper over this one case, then I guess I don't really mind,
just seems like it's probably not worth the effort.

That's fairly normal.  But generally if you get an interrupt, you
have a status field (often write one to clear) and if you clear
the interrupt that you read and have handled from that status, the
interrupt line remains active, so you immediately reenter the handler.

If you have an edge interrupt (which is nasty for this sort of shared
wire case) then you should really do a dance where you clear the
interrupts you think you have dealt with and then check to see if
there are any others - deal with them - then clear them etc
until none are set.

Otherwise you tend to get race conditions.  Even if there aren't any
it's not immediately obvious to a reviewer and making reviewers think
hard is never popular :)

Ah. Good point.

For read_raw interface it's necessary to unwind shift etc, just not the buffered
interface.  The thought is that read_raw is generally low perf and it makes
the userspace processing simpler.

Yes.  The idea is you first check what the interrupt is and only
then act on it if it is a trigger rather than something else.
That can only happen in the thread.

Maybe pm_runtime_set_suspended()?  That should avoid auto suspending
a device that is already autosuspended.  Mind you I get lost in
runtime pm sometimes so that might not work how I think it does...

Fair enough. Guess @return got added when I wasn't looking :)

Only got added recently.  It's indeed and excellent bit of macro magic :)

Same string is fine, but there are some places where explicit matching
is going on like this where hiding it behind a define makes it a bit
trickier to follow the code.  If the content of the string matters
then I think it should be visible at that location.  If it's just
a cookie, or debug info then it's fine to have a define hiding
it's actual content.

Minor thing though, so I'm not that bothered if you really want to use
the define.  Note the compiler may well fuse all the matching strings
anyway.

Nope. Just drop of_match_ptr() protection and it will all work with PRP0001.

For .acpi_match_table you would need a valid ACPI device ID and
I doubt anyone has allocated one for this device.
