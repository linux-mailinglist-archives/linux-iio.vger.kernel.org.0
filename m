I don't see the benefit of the reverse xmas tree. We have discussed this 
already in the past :) I definitely have no need to start using reverse 
xmas tree thingee somewhere it has not been previously used. It may be 
better in _your_ opinion.

He asked me to convert a local array to static const. I though like you 
do now that the local array should not be static but just const - and he 
corrected me in his reply. This can be seen in the discussion I linked 
below.

I don't really see why you talk about "hiding a global variable in a 
function"? A static variable which is declared in function is not 
global. It is local. It causes no more name collisions than a regular 
local variable does so I really don't understand your reasoning.

And how is it different from reading functions where the regular 
variables have identical names? I _really_ can't follow your reasoning.

I _definitely_ miss your point here. I have zero problems reading code 
where static const variables are used in a function. I think it is 
pretty much as hard as seeing a #defined value - difference being that 
one can point to the variable.

I admit that static variables whose value is changed can be more of a 
problem especially when access to function is not serialized.

Bad is a subjective concept. I'd say the code gets much worse if we make 
the local variable a global one.
