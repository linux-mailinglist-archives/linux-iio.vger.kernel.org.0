Good point. I'd got it into my head we had reg matching the channel index
but that doesn't work anyway because those can repeat.   Sorry for misdirec=

Yes, but with you correcting my error above maybe this isn't as clear cut as
I'd falsely recalled.

We do directly relate reg to channel numbers in drivers like the ad7292 (wh=
ere not
all channels are differential)  I'm not convinced either way on what is best
here where reg is currently just an index into a channel specification, not
meaningful for which pins are involved.

It doesn't seem worth adding an equivalent of diff-channels for a single ch=
annel
setup but I guess it would be more consistent.

That statement is the root of disagreement I think.
If they are wired for pseudo differential measurement ADCIN15 a reference v=
oltage
not a varying signal. It can equally be used as a negative channel of
a differential pair.   Not different from point of view of hardware
config, but potentially different from point of view of how the
analog wiring is done and how we may want to present it to userspace.

Whilst you could argue that, I'd counter that a clearly stated pseudo
differential mode with a simple choice of negative input (typically
only one pin is used for these modes), is a feature of the ADC, rather
than a wiring choice such as tying all negative inputs together and to
a reference supply.

Maybe you could argue that if we used the REF- for the negative input.
Otherwise I think it falls into the category where there isn't a clearly de=
fined
pseudo differential mode.

I'd missed until now that the datasheet (I looked ad4114) says aincomm shou=
ld be connected to analog
ground so indeed nothing to turn on in this case and no offset to supply
(the offset will be 0 so we don't present it).

I'll note the datasheet describes the VINCOM as follows.

Voltage-Input Copmmon. Voltage inputs are reference to VINCOM when the inpu=
ts are configured
as single-ended.  Connect AINCOM to analog ground.

The reference to single ended is pretty clear hint to me that this case
is not a differential channel. The more complex case is the one David
raised of the AD4116 where we have actual pseudo differential inputs.

OK, but I'll assume no 'good' customer of ADI will do that as any support
engineer would grumpily point at that statement if they ever reported
a problem :)

For single ended VINCOM should be tied to analog 0V.  If the chip docs allo=
wed
you to tie it to a different voltage then the single ended mode would be of=
fset
wrt to that value.

For the AD4116 case in pseudo differential mode, You would need an ADCIN15 =
supply because
that is not connected to analog 0V.  If the device is being used in a pseud=
o differential
mode that provides a fixed offset voltage.

So my preference (though I could maybe be convinced it's not worth the effo=
rt)
is to treat pseudo differential as single ended channels where 'negative' p=
in is
providing a fixed voltage (or 0V if that's relevant).  Thus measurements pr=
ovided
to userspace include the information of that offset.

We haven't handled pseudo differential channels that well in the past, but =
the
recent discussions have lead to a cleaner overall solution and it would be =
good
to be consistent going forwards.  We could deprecate the previous bindings =
in
existing drivers, but that is a job for another day  (possibly never happen=
s!)
