Better late than never :)

To tell the truth, delays have been Ok. I think Subhajit has not needed 
this urgently and the darkness of the winter in Finland has hindered my 
energy and activity to very low levels.

I think the v2 will ditch this function.

Basically, when scale is greater than max, the division yields values 
smaller than 1. So, when we do rounding, everything equal to or greater 
than 0.5 and smaller than 1 should be rounded upwards. Eg, purely from 
computational perspective, when the "full" is half of the scale, 
division returns 0.5. Thus the check.

But I think your question is very much a valid one. By design the driver 
gives the max value - and I think that scale exceeding this maximum can 
indeed be considered to be invalid. Not that I feel 100% certain on that 
Today :)

part of me says you're right while part of me screams that
1) a _division_ causing overflow is against all that is well and good.
2) if we can cope with the overflow, then we should cope with it.

I am very much undecided what is the best approach here. I'll see how 
much clarity there is in the v2 code, what comments can do and then I'll 
throw it for you to judge :)

Well, luckily the software development can be seen as an iterative 
process :)
