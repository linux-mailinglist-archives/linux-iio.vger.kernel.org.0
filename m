Btw, how would it be solved in ACPI is the playing status bits by
firmware, depending on the run-time detected environment (straps,
other means). So, you may fix it on bootloader / firmware level by
patching DTB with status okay / disabled. I believe in DTB is the
number, which can be easily binary patched.
