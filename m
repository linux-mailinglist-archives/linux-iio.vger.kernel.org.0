In the AD7944 driver, I handled the "3-wire" mode separately because
the sample conversion is triggered on the rising edge of the CNV line.
In "4-wire" mode, since we have a GPIO connected to CNV, we can just
toggle the GPIO from low to high, wait for the conversion time
(t_CONV) and then read the sample (SPI xfer) then toggle the CNV line
low again. In 3-wire mode, the CS line is connected to the CNV pin, so
in order to get an up-to-date sample, we need to to toggle the CS line
from low to high to trigger a conversion (spi xfer with no data, only
delay), then wait for the conversion time, then read the sample (2nd
spi xfer). So in "4-wire" mode, the CS line is getting toggled once
per sample, but in "3-wire" mode, it is getting toggled twice per
sample. I didn't add support for "3-wire" mode where CNV is connected
to GPIO because we can't get max sample rate that way and it is
unusual to not have CS connected to something. But if we do that here,
the timing has to be different from 4-wire mode in order to not get
stale data.

This is a good point. It sounds like additional bindings are needed to
describe the various wiring cases of the SDI line.

It sounds like possibilities are:

1. SDI is hard-wired high -> can't write to registers, CNV is
connected to SPI controller CS, chip is in "3-wire" mode. Currently
adi,spi-mode=3D"single"
2. SDI is connected to SDO of another chip, SDI of last chip is
hard-wired low -> can't write to registers, CNV is connected to SPI
controller CS, chips are in daisy chain mode. Currently
adi,spi-mode=3D"chain"
3. SDI is connected to SPI controller CS -> can't write registers,
chip can operate in 4-wire mode with CNV connected to GPIO, Currently
adi,spi-mode omitted.
4. SDI is connected to SPI controller SDO -> can write registers, and
support all writing modes (3-wire, 4-wire, daisy chain) as long as SPI
controller SDO line can be kept high or low at the appropriate time.
Currently not handled.
5. There could be a pin mux that switches between the one of the first
three and the 4th option (needed to avoid the issue with SPI
controller not being able to place the SDI pin in the correct state
during conversion trigger as described above).

On AD7944, the proposed adi,spi-mode property was sufficient to
describe what was wired to the SDI pin because we only had the first 3
options (the AD7944 doesn't have SPI registers to write to).

Also see related comments in my reply to the DT bindings patch.

(From the complete bindings point of view, we should probably also
consider the possibility of variations of 1. and 2. where CS of the
SPI controller is not wired and CNV is connected to a GPIO - this can
be determined by the combination of the adi,spi-mode property and the
presence or absence of the cnv-gpios property.)

Technically, yes data can be captured in "3-wire" mode with a single
CS toggle, but then the data is stale and doesn't correspond to the
soft timestamp because it is reading the data from the previous
conversion triggered by the last SPI xfer, whenever that was. Since it
is trivial to avoid this by adding the extra CS/CNV toggle I describe
above, I don't see any reason not to.

But the way the driver is written now, it is actually only supporting
the unnamed wiring option 4 from above, so now I understand the
confusion about 3-wire vs. 4-wire mode in that context.

In the device tree bindings, making vref-supply required makes sense
since there is no internal reference.  In the driver, as discussed in
V1, it will fail if vref-supply in regulator_get_voltage() if
vref-supply is missing and we use devm_regulator_get() instead of
devm_regulator_get_optional(). So leaving it as-is is fine. We have a
plan to clean this up later anyway.

If it isn't that much work, it seems worth it to me. If the driver
work is too much, maybe just split the DT patch?

This doesn't sound like something that belongs in DT since it doesn't
depend on the physical properties of what is wired to the input.

But the fact that offset should not be read until after scale is set
sounds like a quirk that would be worth documenting in some
chip-specific docs.

If the ADC CNV pin is connected to a GPIO and the ADC SDI pin is
connected to SDO of the SPI controller, then nothing is connected to
CS of the SPI controller, so that might be the problem.
