Is indexed set for the channel?  Check it at the point of calling
devm_iio_device_register() as the code that builds the channels in this
driver is complex, so maybe it's getting overwritten?

There might be a core bug somewhere, but there are other drivers using
-1 scan index without hitting this problem so my first instinct is
something is getting wrongly set in the driver.
