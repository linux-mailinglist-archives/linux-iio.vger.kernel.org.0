If you didn't enable them all, the IIO core would then grab them all anyway
but demux the data out that you actually wanted.  So you would only notice
if you looked at the data transfers happening which were probably larger
than necessary.

More digits would turn up :) Otherwise you are correct and I wasn't thinking
this through. You'd hope that the code reading them would be fine.

I had a patch adding to precision of IIO_VAL_FRACTION_LOG2 a while
back on basis we'd 'get away with it'.

Not sure I ever picked it up though :(

That is a fairly common problem with using other triggers. Will we get no
data, or stale data?  If just stale, but some guarantee on not too stale
then usually fine to just return that.

That separation is often messy / unclear.  So it is kind of best effort
+ making it work with external triggers if possible.

I do :)  Mostly because I don't want readers to have to know it doesn't
matter.  It will never fail anyway in reasonable systems.

Don't care that much.  Though I'll probably forget I said that
and moan about it in next version :)
