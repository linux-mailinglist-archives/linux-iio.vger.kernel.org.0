After you explained me that we don't need the extra hassle with the 
negative values (specific two's complement handling) - I do agree. If we 
needed to check the high bit in reg X to detect if special handling is 
required (as I thought) - then I would have still thought that checking 
the high bit from u8 which matches the spec would be much clearer. But 
yes - in this case, after your explanation - I do agree. Thanks :)

Yes. This makes sense also to me now that we don't really need the:

 >>>>>> +		negative = true;
 >>>>>> +	else
 >>>>>> +		negative = false;

shown above.

No. You don't miss a thing. I didn't know if it's ok to treat i6bit 
two's complement just as a native 16bit signed integer.

I need to look at the spec and the get_unaligned_le24() to be able to 
say something :) I wrote this code before my summer holidays but didn't 
have the time to test and send the patches until now. Will get back to 
this IC later this week.

Thanks for the feedback guys!
