Thanks for the example. This helped me prototyping a dfsdm driver based 
on the converter framework. Regarding device tree and driver update this 
looks fine. I could integrate the API smartly in my frontend (dfsdm) and 
backend (sd modulator).

My prototype executes up to probe. I have noticed however that init 
(backend & frontend) ops are not called in my implementation. I can see 
that init ops are called from bind ops. component_bind_all() calls 
converter bind ops, but component_bind_all() is called from converter 
bind ops. So, I don't understand how initialization can proceed with 
these circular calls. Maybe I missed something here.

The change in the DT has an impact (But moderated) on legacy. Breaking 
the legacy was unavoidable anyway.

DFSDM legacy binding (with two channels)
       dfsdm_pdm1: filter@1 {
         compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
         st,adc-channels = <2 3>;
         st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R", "SPI_R";
         ...
         io-channels = <&sd_adc2 &sd_adc3>;
       };

DFSDM binding with converter fw
     dfsdm_pdm1: filter@1 {
         compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
         st,adc-channels = <2 3>;
         st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R", "SPI_R";
         ...
         converters = <&sd_adc2 &sd_adc3>;
       };

I have also the aim to change DFSDM bindings to use IIO generic channels 
bindings (bindings/iio/adc/adc.yaml).

Ideally the DFSDM bindings should looks like this:
       dfsdm_pdm1: filter@1 {
         compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
         channel@2 {
                 reg = <2>;
                 st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R";
                 ...
                 converters = <&sd_adc2>;
         };
         channel@3 {
                 reg = <3>;
                 st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R";
                 ...
                 converters = <&sd_adc3>;
         };
       };

But it seems that current framework converter API cannot support this 
topology.

As a fallback solution the following binding may be adopted
       dfsdm_pdm1: filter@1 {
         compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
         channel@2 {
                 reg = <2>;
                 st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R";
                 ...
         };
         channel@3 {
                 reg = <3>;
                 st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R";
                 ...
         };
         converters = <&sd_adc2 &sd_adc3>;

In this case the frontend driver needs a mean to map backend and 
channels. It's not the smartest solution, yet. Especially since the use 
of generic channel is quite common.
Perhaps the converter_frontend_add() API needs to be extended to support 
generic channel configuration. Maybe the IIO core should provide the 
related helpers as well. (As far as I know this does not exists).
So, still opened questions ..

That said, I feel confident that the converter framework is a good 
option for the DFSDM use case.
