Yeah, I'm keeping the series small (as Jonathan asked in the RFC) and just =
with basic
stuff needed to get the ad9647 driver in the exact same state as before the
framework. So yes, it's the same deal as with the component approach. You'l=
l need to
add support for it. But, in this case, I believe it should be as straight a=
