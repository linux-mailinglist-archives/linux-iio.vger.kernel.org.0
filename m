Hm. As far as I can say the masklength is constant telling how many bits 
there is in one mask(?) I don't think we can reduce it. Idea is just to 
increment the av_masks pointer until we find the zero mask indicating 
end of an array. This is how we count the amount of masks in the array.

Caveat being that if driver has used single long '0' to indicate the end 
of an array, and if the masklength > 32 - we'll end up reading out of 
bounds. (as we agreed later in the mail. OTOH, we also agreed there does 
not seem to be drivers with masklength > 32 utilizing the 
available_scan_masks - so this is just trying to avoid problems in the 
future).

I didn't find one either.

Exactly my thinking, and why I think this fix would be fragile. I am not

I think I agree. At least for as long as we don't actually have any 
available_scan_masks users with masklength > 32

Well, not 100% sure I interpret the idiom correctly ;) In any case, I'd 
say this would indeed postpone dealing with the problem to the future. 
To the point we actually seem to have a problem. The "long grass" as if 
hiding the problem is something we can avoid by adding something like:

if (masklength > 32 && idev->available_scan_masks) {
	/*
	 * Comment mowing the long grass.
	 */
	dev_err( ...);
	return -EINVAL;
}

to the device registration.

I think we could. Or, maybe develop some mask initialization macro 
magic. It'd just be cool if one did not need to do things differently 
for multi long masks.

don't know how would it work to have
unsigned long available_masks[][1] = {
	{mask0},
	{mask1},
	{}
};

for regular masks with 1 long / mask as well? At first look it seems 
horrible to me but at least it would be a standard :) Don't know if 
there is a sane way to make a macro for it.

Well, at least it shouldn't hurt to have some example - although I'm 
still tempted to use the "long grass" - option ;)
