I think in that case we need these other pieces too. And we need acks from
relevant subsystems that these other pieces are a) ready for upstream
merging and also that the dma-buf side of things actually makes sense.

Do you have a link for this? I just checked dri-devel on lore, and it's
not there. Nor anywhere else.

We really need all the pieces, and if block layer reaction is anything to
judge by, dma-buf wont happen for networking either. There's some really
nasty and fairly fundamental issues with locking and memory reclaim that
make this utter pain or outright impossible.
