A given IIO device driver may create multiple sysfs directories (registers
device + one or more triggers), so I'm not sure how this would work.

Yes, don't touch that ABI.  IIO software assumes naming of
iio\:deviceX etc.

There are labels for channels as well as devices, but the short description
you have above is it.

I don't see why that isn't sufficient for your use case though?
What does a directory name matter when you can write a few lines of
code to retrieve the IIO device that you want.

If this was day 0 maybe we could support renaming devices like this
but we have a long history of those names not being stable and label
+ parentage of the IIO devices being used to establish stable identification.

Anything beyond a trivial single use script is going to need to deal with
not having stable names (old kernel, dt without alias etc) so this doesn't
help in general.
