It runs whenever the enabled mask requested (the channels that are enabled)=
 is
different from the active_scan_mask. It only sends channels in one
direction if there is only one user but it only sends the ones enabled by t=
hat consumer.
It's called unconditionally from iio_enable_buffers()

That iterates over all enabled buffers (often there is only 1)

and then checks if the active scan mask is the same as the one for this buf=
fer.
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9-rc6/source/drivers/iio/industrialio-b=
uffer.c#L1006

The setup for whether to find a superset from available_scan_masks is here
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9-rc6/source/drivers/iio/industrialio-b=
uffer.c#L928

Key is that if it happens to match, then we don't actually do anything in t=
he demux.
It just gets passed straight on through.  That does the fast path you menti=
on below.

Agreed -that one is needed to shuffle the temperature to the right place.
