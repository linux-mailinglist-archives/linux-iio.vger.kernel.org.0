Based on my experience, I would recommend that counter drivers be as
"thin" as possible. They shouldn't try to provide any information that
the hardware itself doesn't provide. In other words, the kernel should
provide userspace the information needed to calculate the speed/rate
but not try to do the actual calculation in the kernel. Inevitably
there are nuances for specific use cases that can't all possibly be
handled by such an implementation.

I've tried using gpio interrupts to try to calculate speed/rate in
the kernel before and it simply doesn't work reliably. Interrupts
get missed and the calculation will be off.

For really slow counts (i.e. 1 count/second), I can see a use for
generating an event on each count though. For high rates, I would
just read the count every 100ms in usespace and divide the change in
the number of counts by the time period to get the rate.
