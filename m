The two of you are definitely the most familiar with the code and the restr=
ictions
around it, so ideally I'd like you go figure out the path forwards and tell=
 me :)

To me this is a non core extension of IIO so as long as we end up with some=
thing
maintainable that solves some (all?) of the ordering and dependency issues =
I'll
be happy.  I'd rather not have two solutions of course if there is not a go=
od
reason why they have to be different.  If we do end up with two solutions I
want clear documentation for the restrictions of each so that we hopefully
don't end up with a 3rd solution down the line.
