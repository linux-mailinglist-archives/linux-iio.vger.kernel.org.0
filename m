Do basic editing & correction to intel-ish-hid.rst:
- fix grammar, verb tense, punctutation, and word phrasing
- fix spellos
- hyphenate multi-word adjectives
- collapse 2 spaces to one space in the middle of sentences
- use "I2C" instead of lower-case letters (as Linux I2C does)
- change space indentation to tab
- use HID instead of hid consistently
- use a list so that some line items do not run together
- use "a UUID" instead of "an UUID"
