Patch is good.  The binding should state these are required - it doesn't
mean that the driver will fail to probe on systems that doesn't provide
them.  It does encourage any new DTS files to incorporate them which is
good to have.

Only thing that needs changing is the patch should not justify the
addition of these to the binding because they 'are required in the
driver implementation'.  Just drop that statement and the patch is
fine.

As long as the patch doesn't say anything about what the driver does
then it is fine.  Note DT bindings and patch descriptions for them should
never mention the driver.
