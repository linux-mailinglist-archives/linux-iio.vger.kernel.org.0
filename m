I didn't have time to reply to the series yet, but I think this isn't a
great idea. There are two issues:

- With devres, you don't have full control over the order in which
  resources will be released, which means that you can't control the
  power off sequence, in particular if it needs to be sequenced with
  GPIOs and clocks. That's not a concern for all drivers, but this API
  will creep in in places where it shouldn't be used, driver authours
  should really pay attention to power management and not live with the
  false impression that everything will be handled automatically for
  them. In the worst cases, an incorrect power off sequence could lead
  to hardware damage.

- Powering regulators on at probe time and leaving them on is a very bad
  practice from a power management point of view, and should really be
  discouraged. Adding convenience helpers to make this easy is the wrong
  message, we should instead push driver authors to implement proper
  runtime PM.
