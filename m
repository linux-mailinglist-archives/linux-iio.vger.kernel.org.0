It's fine to have a channel that doesn't have controls or the ability
to be read.

We do have history of doing what you have here (a couple
of accelerometers do it) but it's esoteric and rather hard for userspace
to comprehend so I'd rather not introduce it for other types of devices.

I think we should go with the most flexible option of allowing
events to trigger when they 'may be true' to incorporate this case.
Unfortunately I can't see another option that would scale to all the
random combinations of events that might occur.  There are all sorts
of extensions we could make to the event descriptions, but only at the
cost of breaking backwards compatibility and simplicity.

SWith hindsight the whole IIO_MOD_X_OR_Y_OR_Z mess was a design error :(
We can teach userspace code about that quirk for accelerations where
the one that would be hard to handle is the AND case used for
freefall detectors (you detect that the signal magnitude is near 0 for
all axes).  I can't think of another option for that one other than
the weird modifier (unlike this case)

Probably needs something similar to channel labelling, so a separate
callback given we don't handle strings, but sure something like this
would be useful and provide 'hints' along the lines of what the
datasheet calls a particular event.  Not however for what event is sent
as such info should be apparent from the event naming.
