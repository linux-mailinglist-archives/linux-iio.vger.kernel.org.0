Others covered it much better than I would have done :)

Ok.  So the issue is the reverse lookup in there.

Been a while since I looked at how that bit worked, but IIRC there
is a disadvantage in that using the validate_scan_mask path
doesn't let us use the demux.  So that means we can only
start the buffer if using a mask from the below.  

Hence if we have XY it won't start.  If we do it via 
available_scan_masks (with the resulting duplication) of
some of the information in the driver, then we'll be able to enable
just those two channels and the core will pick XYZ and drop
the Z channel for us automatically.

yup.  It will be one whenever the device is being used (events or
data).

That sounds like it might be premature optimization but interesting
idea if you can justify the complexity.

ok. Definitely add a comment on that as wasn't obvious to me at least :)

I'm not sure the balance is right though as side effect might be a longer bus transaction
and those tend to be much more complex than a bit of indirection to use a dma safe buffer
in adxl367_state.

Probably dependent on external circuitry making it impossible to
define in the datasheet so you could add a fw property to describe it.
There are various similar cases for other devices.

Unlikely to be many that are actually in a fast path, but it is 'possible'.

Of course :)  I just want easy to read code where possible as then
I don't have to think too much if I need to do something with this driver
in 5+ years time!

Perhaps a comment providing information here on what the data layout
actually is would be in order?

A realloc strategy would mean you only did the alloc once, but that would
indeed make it more complex.

I'll plead brain being slow on Sunday due to booster vaccine though
sadly I only get to use that excuse occasionally :)
