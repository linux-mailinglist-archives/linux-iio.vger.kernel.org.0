I don't understand: what are the bindings for the device itself? What is
this patch/binding if not device itself?

Where are they? There is nothing in the upstream, so maybe that's just
misconfigured downstream DTS?

Or maybe these are just some sort of IP core designs which cannot be
used in real case alone/directly.

None of above make sense because they are again versioned or generic.
Use final product names, assuming they are such.
