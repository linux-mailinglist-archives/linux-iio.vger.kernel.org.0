Hello Jonathan,

Thank you for comments. I have a several questions about the flow,
please find them below.

Could you please explain what it means? Do you have some testing branch
with such dangerous patches or do we need just to wait other developers
for more points of view? Thanks in advance.

I fully agree with you. I suppose to resolve such a problem we need to
have some indicators that the trigger is already registered or not.
From my point of view, trig->list entry fits well to answer this question.
Trigger is added to the global IIO triggers list during register()
execution, so we can just check that entry is not empty to make sure that
trigger is registered.

I've sent a v2 patch version, where I use trig->list entry empty status to
warn it:
