While trying to do this and testing it, I've realized that indeed when
the BUS is broken (e.g. incorrect wiring) the probe() fails even
earlier. When we are unable to communicate with the device, this is
caught by the lower layer protocols (e.g. I2C sees no ACK, I suppose),
so there is no need to fail here; the IIO device doesn't eventually
pop up anyway.

So, I now revert my previous request to keep a check to bail out for
crazy IDs here :) ; I'd say we can just relax the check to just a
warning as you said before, without the need for checking for 0x00 and
0xff..
