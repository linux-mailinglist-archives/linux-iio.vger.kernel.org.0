I apologize for the confusion.

What I was trying to say is that to have the bmi323 working in those aforementioned devices bmc150 will need to be modified: that is the probe function that ends up being executed, fact that cannot be changed because it depends on the ACPI implementation shipped on those devices. 

Therefore I was asking about the best way of handing control to the new driver and how that should be organized: in my implementation the new bmi323 code was written inside the bmc150-accel-core.c and only shares sleep/suspend, probe and removal functions in addition to checking for the new chip presence before checking for any bmc150 chip as that issues an i2c write, while the check for the bmi323 only requires an i2c read.

We also have done duplicate work as I have written a driver for that chip myself, but it's not as good as yours because my hardware didn't come with the IRQ pin connected and so I couldn't develop triggers and I only got the i2c interface working.

TIA for your time.
