Hi Julia,


Would be nice to have shadow variable detection enabled (QEMU did
that recently and it caught various bugs).

I'm not sure if this helps or not with readability and get the feeling
that people will perpetually send patches to remove the pointless
macro argument. I guess a comment on why it is there might avoid that
well enough though.

yes.

And onwards in that thread.

Linus was pretty clear that constructor and destructor should come together
and gave an example at the end of that email 

+	lines = gpio_sim_count_lines(bank);
+	char **line_names __free(kfree) = kcalloc(lines, sizeof(*line_names), GFP_KERNEL);

Reality was that the cleanup.h macros were doing this anyway it just was
somewhat hidden in guard() and friends.

Thanks for putting together a script so quickly.
