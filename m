Gah.  Merge into IIO doesn't build because of dropping of.h from includes
in iio.h.  This driver should directly include property.h directly.

New 'immutable' branch with same name pushed out.  Guessing no one picked
it up in the minute or so previous version was available for!

I'd advise that Lee / Stephen don't merge this for a few days at least so
any other issues have become visible and I can fix them up without making
for complex history.

Thanks,

Jonathan
