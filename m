Hi Jonathan,

Thank you for the review.

Sure, I will add all ABI's in the cover letter.

Please note that I omitted certain portions of your reviews
while responding, and I agree with the review comments that
I didn't address. I intend to make the necessary corrections
in the next series.

Yes both buffers are used at the same time. In fifo_flush
fifo_buff is used to store all fifo data, and buffer is
used to push a single data frame to iio buffers, overlapping
will corrupt the data, so I used separate buffers for both.

Andy also suggested the same.
Sure I will use helpers from cleanup.h.

Yes, oversampling can be used, but changing the average
value doesn't alter the sampling frequency. The sampling
frequency is same even with the increase in averaging value.

Yes, irq_type is not required __setup_irq() is handling that.

No specific reason, during testing the feature engine was
taking around 4 milliseconds, so I thought of checking
every 2 milliseconds and max of 5 trials.

Yes, the basic read of channels will be available even
if none of the interrupts are wired and trigger buffer
through sysfs or hrt timer is also available.

A buffer size of 2028 bytes is required when configuring
the FIFO watermark for maximum capacity. Since the
necessary buffer size is substantial, I am allocating
it dynamically.

I will try to use an additional buffer from the device's
private structure and pass it through the context.
This approach will help reduce the memory allocation
and deallocation on every device access.

For spi with pad_bits=3D8 and without any custom read and
write functions, regmap_read() works but regmap_write()
does not. Write is also adding 8 bits of padding and
the device is treating it as data.
