When going through the code of the buffer-cb interface and all it's
users, I realized that the stm32_adfsdm driver is calling
`iio_channel_get_all_cb()` with NULL for the cb. After going a bit
trough the stm drivers, it looks like this is actually intentional.
However, it is clear that we have a clear/direct route here for a NULL
pointer dereference. I'm being lazy in this RFC and just doing a
sanity check in the `iio_buffer_cb_store_to()` so that we don't have to
change the stm driver... The point is just to bring this up and see if
we want to do something about this.

To be clear, the way I think this should go is just to return -EINVAL in
`iio_channel_get_all_cb()` if a NULL ptr is passed. Whats the point of a
buffer-cb if cb is NULL, right? This would naturally break the stm
driver, but I guess we could just define a dummy handler there that
would not be used (or could the HW consumer be an option here?)...

Thoughts?
