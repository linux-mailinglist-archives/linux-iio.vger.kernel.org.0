Ok, good! As usual, just a few inline comments, ok for the rest.

Hum. I'm confused here: I think I did set it to NULL (is some later
LOC) in V2, but you argued against it, because hopefully
request_firmware() does it by itself.
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-iio/msg64896.html

What has changed or what I've missed? Was your original point just to
move the NULL assignment back at declaration time?

To be honest my point wasn't about the correctness of the DT at all..

I've hit this several times when I was switching my test board from
serial to i2c and vice-versa, because I made wrong connections or I
forgot to switch FPGA image (which contains the serial IP here). I got
my test script failing because the IIO device didn't pop up at all,
which is better than getting e.g. random data. In the real world
people may have less chance to have to worry about this, but they may
when e.g. they have an RPi and a hand-wired IMU.

.. IOW I'm seeing this as a hardware self-test rather than a SW
check.. But if the DT thing makes this a no-go, then I can live with
the warning, and e.g. by making my script to check the kernel log..
