Thanks for breaking it up.

Fault reporting is a continuing problem across all similar subsystems.
Every now and then there is a discussion about something 'generic' as
in most cases you want faults to surface separately from the main datastream.
Unfortunately no one ever did more than talk about it as far as I know.

I'm not keen on the flags channel because it's effectively custom to a particular
driver.  Describing the various possible bits in a way generic software can
interpret them is really challenging.  Faults tend to be a lot less 'consistent
in form' than actual data.  You are correct that at least some of these
could be mapped to channels though.

Some of these we could consider 'normal' events.

Not really related to any channel.  It's pushing the boundaries
a little but you could add an alternating voltage channel and
describe this as a threshold being crossed on that.  It's a bit
of a stretch but it is something existing tooling should handle
even if it's not easy to interpret the error.

> | D6  |  Sine/cosine inputs below LOS threshold
Also a threshold on the input alternative voltage channel.
Problem here is that IIO only supports one threshold. So you
would need to figure out how to handle this vs the clip detection.

> | D5  |  Sine/cosine inputs exceed DOS overrange threshold
Not 100% sure I understood this one right, but could it be considered
an over threshold condition?
> | D4  |  Sine/cosine inputs exceed DOS mismatch threshold
My knowledge of resolvers is a little limited, but this could
be considered an event on a differential channel (between
sine and cosine inputs.

> | D3  |  Tracking error exceeds LOT threshold
Not sure if this one is expected to occur except at reset.
It describes it as result of a step change in rotational position
which feels like something that doesn't happen other than when
device is reset... Could be wrong though!

> | D2  |  Velocity exceeds maximum tracking rate
This one is I think just a threshold on velocity matching what the
hardware is capable of.

> | D1  |  Phase error exceeds phase lock range


> | D0  |  Configuration parity error
This one has nothing to do with the data. I'd spit a log message
out if you see it. Chances are device is dead. You 'could' keep
a cache of what you think should be in the registers and try
a full reset and re configuration.  Like any other parity error
though you will want to have something watching for repeats that
mean the part needs replacing.
