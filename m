Hi Rob,

To make things more clear, following is the modalias info of the device.

(B+)(root@linux iio:device0)# cat 
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-PRP0001\:01/modalias
of:NltrfTCltr,ltrf216a

It's a dt namespace on an ACPI based device. We used an of_device_id 
table to be able to probe the driver
using the vendor prefix and compatible string.

But when we compile the driver, we get the following warning and hence 
we documented it in vendor-prefixes.yaml
and also added a complete device tree file [Patch 3/3] just to get rid 
of the warning. In real life we are not using
the device tree file at all.

WARNING: DT compatible string vendor "ltr" appears un-documented -- check
./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.yaml 364: FILE:
drivers/iio/light/ltrf216a.c:313: + { .compatible = "ltr,ltrf216a" },

There are many existing devices used by people which has the vendor 
prefix name as 'ltr'
and it won't be possible to change that hence we are trying to upstream it.


Thanks,
Shreeya Patel
