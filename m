Hi Angelo,

MT6370 is just a SubPMIC, not an SoC, and is applied in cellular
telephones, tablet PCs, and portable instruments.
And the PWM mode of the MT6370 backlight driver is optional, and not
must be enabled.
From our perspective, this MT6370 backlight driver is not the same as
mtk-pwm-disp related driver.
Thanks!
