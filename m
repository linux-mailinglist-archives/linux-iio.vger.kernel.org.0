Unfortunately we need to hear from the Aya-Neo, if they ever care about their
products. Without that it would make an unfortunate precedent which will open
a Pandora's box (means a green light on abusing ACPI specification and other's
IPs, yes, Intellectual Property in this case, as ID is an IP of the corresponding
vendor).

I'm fine if Realtek doesn't care about their IDs to be (ab)used by somebody else,
the main problem here is on Aya-Neo side.

Is there any engineer-to-engineer connection with Aya-Neo? Because using that
info@ address may be simply ignored / went to spam / etc.
