Hi All,

I'll be on vacation with limited internet from Wednesday.
This means the 'theoretical' cut off date for IIO for 5.15 is pulled forwards
a few days. It would have been late this week anyway and sometimes I cut off
earlier than that without giving warning :)
For reference, IIO cuts off at least a week before a likely merge window opening,
so typically before rc6.

I'm not sure yet whether I will do a second pull request before the 18th, though
I have a few things lined up so I'll go with 'probably'.

Thanks,

Jonathan
