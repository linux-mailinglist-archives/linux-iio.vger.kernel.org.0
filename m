I've just had another good look at ADXL367. It seems that I'm quick at
forgetting stuff about the code I write.

In adxl367_set_fifo_samples(), fifo_watermark is multiplied by
fifo_set_size, then, if it is larger than the maximum watermark,
it is capped at the maximum watermark, and then, it is divided
by fifo_set_size again.

In the end, fifo_watermark actually seems to mean number of scans
in that driver too.

So this was a huge confusion. The different thing about AD4130 is that
the register actually means number of samples, and not number of scans,
so that's where that confussion stemmed from.

Sorry for wasting your time on this.
