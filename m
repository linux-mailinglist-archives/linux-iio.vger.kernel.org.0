Ah. That's handy.

That would be great.  Unfortunately drivers sometimes bit rot
without testing.

Any plans to post updated roadtest soon?  I'm keen to add more test cases
and use it to cleanup the remaining staging drivers.  Very helpful tool,
but I don't want to be developing test sets against an old version if
it's going to be costly to forward port it. No great rush though as
I've bitten off a bit more than I was aiming to in prep for plumbers so
not going to get anything significant done in IIO until mid September.

Thanks,

Jonathan
