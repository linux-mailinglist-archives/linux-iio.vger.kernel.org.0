Would it be possible to make it so that userspace can't modify the
events_list when IRQs are enabled? Then we wouldn't have to add asecond event buffer.

IIRC, the only operations that modify events_list are when another
list replaces events_list when events are enabled and when
events_list is cleared when events are disabled. So as long as the
ordering is right with respect to enabling and disabling IRQs, it
seems like the spin lock should not be needed.
