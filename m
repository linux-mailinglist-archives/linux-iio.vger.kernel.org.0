I'm going to take a multi pronged approach to trying to get us on the same
page design wise.   I've replied to v3 with code snippets that will hopefully
convey the explanation I'm giving here.

Data ready triggers always provide some blurring of the nice clean
trigger -> IIO CORE HANDLING -> device handling to grab data and push it out..
but we have a fairly standard model for this and whilst limited in functionality
I think the max1027 was keeping to this model.

True, but there are two steps to this.
1) The trigger IRQ fires.  That then calls a tree of other interrupts
(iio_trigger_poll()).
One of that tree of interrupts is attached by the driver.
That interrupt handler is then called to actually take the data indicated
by the EOC interrupt and push it to the buffer.  Note this second interrupt
is registered as part of iio_triggered_buffer_setup() which is why that
function takes interrupt handlers.

That is true in your code, but it is not the correct way to do this because
in the event of a trigger other than the EOC one, we should not have the
interrupt to indicate the end of the read we are manually starting calling
into the handler for the trigger (as it wasn't the trigger!) - it should
be handled at the level above that.

If you have a different trigger than the EOC one provided by this driver then
the top level interrupt handler (the one that actually handles the EOC interrupt
should not call iio_trigger_generic_data_ready_poll() because we need to do
something different in that interrupt handler.  It is this handler that
you should modify so that it does different things depending on whether or
not the EOC trigger is in use. (you can check this using iio_trigger_using_own(iio_dev))

I've tried to find a simple example of this, but they are all rather convoluted for
various device specific reasons (getting the best possible timestamp for example)

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/iio/pressure/zpa2326.c#L786
more or less follows the model I'm describing with some rather fiddly timestamp
handling..

Yes.

This nearly works, but I think the trigger reference counting will be broken
because you call iio_trigger_notify_done() without calling iio_trigger_poll().
You could cheat and drop the notify_done() - which is the solution used when
we have fifos involved and hence have to do a still more complex dance but
that isn't the right solution here.

This is more complex than should be needed and doesn't fit the model IIO
uses to separate triggers and data capture.

A few 'rules' which get bent occasionally, particularly when a driver only
supports it's own trigger.
* iio_trigger_poll() only called in an interrupt handler that is handling
  the interrupt which is the trigger in use.  So in this case, only when
  the driver is configured to use the EOC based trigger.
* iio_push_to_buffers_*(), iio_trigger_notify_done() only called from a
  trigger handler which is registered with iio_triggered_buffer_setup))

To keep to this set of rules we need two paths in the trigger irq handler
and in the trigger handler (the one on the 'device' side of the internal
irq chip that IIO uses to 'broadcast' triggers).

I may well have messed up details in the following but hopefully I manage
to convey the basic approach I'm suggesting.

So replace that iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() with one that does
something along the lines of

irqreturn_t irq_handler(int irq, void *private)
{
	struct iio_dev *indio_dev = private;
	struct max1027_state *st = iio_priv(indio_dev);

	if (!iio_buffer_enabled(indio_dev) ||
	    !iio_trigger_using_own(trigger) {
		complete(st->completion);
		return IRQ_HANDLED;
	}
	/* So we only use this as a trigger - if it is the trigger! */
	return iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll(st->trig, irq); 	
}

registered in the 
dev_request_threaded_irq() call with the private parameter changed to indio_dev
as you have done in v3.

and

irqreturn_t trigger_handler(void *private, int irq)
{
	struct iio_poll_func *pf = private;
	struct io_dev *indio_dev = pf->indio_dev;

	if (!iio_trigger_using_own(indio_dev)) {
		ret = max1027_configure_chans_and_start(indio_dev);
		if (ret)
			return IRQ_HANDLED;

		ret = max1027_wait_eoc(indio_dev);
		if (ret)
			return IRQ_HANDLED;

	 	ret = max1027_read_scan(indio_dev);
		if (ret)
			return IRQ_HANDLED;	
		iio_trigger_notify_done(indio_dev);
		return IRQ_HANDLED;
	} else {
		ret = max1027_read_scan(indio_dev);
		if (ret)
			dev_err(&indio_dev->dev,
			"Cannot read scanned values (%d)\n", ret);
	
		iio_trigger_notify_done(indio_dev->trig);
	
		return IRQ_HANDLED;
	}
/* Feel free to rearrange as you like! */
