Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] Introduce max12xx ADC support

Hello, here is a patchset updating the existing max1027.c driver (for
10-bit max1027/29/31 ADCs) with a few corrections/improvements and
then introducing their 12-bit cousins named max1227/29/31.

As on my hardware setup the "start conversion" and "end of conversion"
pin are not wired (which is absolutely fine for this chip), I also
updated the driver and the bindings to support optional interrupts. In
this case, triggered buffers are not available and the user must poll
the value from sysfs.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l


Changes in v3:
==============
* Updated the commit message of the patch adding debugfs read access
  to better explain why I decided to limit the number of bytes read to
  two.
* Updated the macros to define the number of channels per device as
  proposed by Jonathan.
* Re-used the realbits entry instead of adding my own (called .depth).
* Started doing DT-bindings yaml conversion, but realized that after
  the first patch offering the interrupt as optional, the
  documentation was fitting pretty well the trivial devices
  representation. Dropped the specific bindings files and updated the
  trivial devices list instead.

Changes in v2:
==============
* Removed the addition of three compatibles from patch 4 (the
  preparation patch) to add these lines back in patch 5 (the actual
  introduction).
