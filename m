I'd forgotten the discussion completely ;)
My main question was why bother with slow?  You can do it without the GPIO
anyway as there is a register bit for it.

I can conceive of various possible reasons, the evil one being that it's
actually out of the host processors control. Is that what we care about here?
If so it's nothing to do with a GPIO in the Linux sense at all and we can
assume that it's not connected to an interrupt at the same time.

We 'might' need a control for that case that says configure the device for
an external entity to use the slow pin.

It wouldn't be the first device to have that sort of thing, but normally they
are sequencing pins that are wired up to some mechanical device or similar.

I'll admit I've long forgotten what was going on here, but based just on
this bit of text I agree. There is nothing 'stopping' us having a pin
uses as either / or / both interrupt and gpio.

It'll be a bit messy to support in the driver as IIRC there are some sanity
checks that limit combinations on IRQs and output GPIOS.  Can't remember
how bad the dance to navigate it safely is.

First version I'd just say pick one option if both are provided and
don't support configuring it at runtime.
