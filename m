Not sure if it would help but maybe it's worth a local define
of something like

#define MULT9 1000000000LL
to loose the association with any particular SI basis and
just indicate it's a bit number being used to retain precision
in some maths?  Would need a comment to stop people sending
patches to replace it with GIGA though ;)

My ultimate preference here is for whatever works for Peter and
Liam as the people who are mostly likely to have to deal
with any changes to this driver in the future.
