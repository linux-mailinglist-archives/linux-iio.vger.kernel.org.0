Until now I think we've only had the phase modifier for output channels.
So at minimum need to add documentation for it in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio

However, the snag is that it's defined in terms of radians.
The usecase here assumes that the sensor is measuring some sort of
wave form, but unfortunately we don't know what that is - hence
the setting is in terms of clock delay.

As such, though the datasheet calls if phase, I think that is
stretching the meaning too far in the IIO ABI. We probably need
something new.  

Years ago, for devices that are actually a single ADC and a MUX
where we pretend in IIO that the channels are sampled synchronously
we talked about provided the timing delay information to userspace.
Nothing ever came of it, but that is effectively the same concept
as you have here.

So, it's a time measurement so units will need to be seconds -
userspace has no idea of the clk speed of a device. For two channels
the relationship is straight forward, but I wonder for 3 channel devices
how we would handle it.  The two different sources of this delay might
lead to different controls being optimal.

Naming wise, perhaps samplingdelay?

If you have actual ADCs that operate independently then relationship to
a base reference point will be independent. 
So for a 3 channel device you'd have

in_voltage0_samplingdelay  0
in_voltage1_samplingdelay  Phase register 1 code / DMCLK
in_voltage2_samplingdelay  Phase register 2 code / DMCLK

But for a device that is a mux in front of one actual ADC
then the timing is likely to be relative to previous channel
Hence if all turned on...

in_voltage0_samplingdelay  0
in_voltage1_samplingdelay  Phase register 1 code / DMCLK
in_voltage2_samplingdelay  Phase register 2 code + Phase register 1 code / DMCLK

If only 0 and 2 enabled.

in_voltage0_samplingdelay  0
in_voltage2_samplingdelay  Phase register X code

However we can probably just make that problem for the driver. Sometimes
we'll have to reject or approximate particular combinations of enabled channels
and requested delays. 
One corner case that is nasty will be if there is just one controllable delay.
In that case it would seem natural to have just one attribute, but the delay
would be cumulative across multiple enabled channels.  For that I think
we'd just need different ABI.

in_voltage_intersampledelay  maybe?  With two channels the various options
would all work but we should think ahead...

There is another complexity. These values apply to the buffered data, not
otherwise. Moving them into bufferX/ would nicely associate them with the
enabled channels and make it more obvious that there is a coupling there

However, it is more complex to add attributes to the buffers..
If we think that is the right way to go for ABI it wouldn't be too hard to
add to the core - but will need a new callback.

So my gut feeling is that this should be

bufferX/in_voltage0_samplingdelay 0
bufferX/in_voltage1_samplingdelay Phase register 1 code / DMCLK seconds
but it is a rather nasty layering violation.

That will require us adding a new callback read_scan_el_raw() and appropriate
enum etc.

Things will get more complex for 3 channel deviceson multibuffer devices or when there are in
kernel consumers (as those may effect the enabled channels but aren't visible in
bufferX).  However, I don't see it being that likely we'll get that combination
of features any time soon (famous last words!)

Gut feeling is that adding this feature (and discussion of ABI) will
take a while, but it shouldn't block picking up the rest of the series
in the meantime.
