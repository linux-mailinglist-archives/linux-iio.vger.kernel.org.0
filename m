Nothing mean here. This is according to a prior (off-list) agreement.

I didn't think it was worth it either, so left it out. Easy enough to
add though.

I used "3-wire" because that is what the datasheet calls it. But yes,
I see the potential for confusion here since this "3-wire" is
completely unrelated to the standard "spi-3wire" property.

If there isn't a clear precedent for how to write bindings for chained
devices, this may be something better left for when there is an actual
use case to be sure we get it right.

This can actually be done two ways. One where there is no CS and we
use cnv-gpios to control the conversion. The other is where CS of the
SPI controller is connected to the CNV pin on the ADC and cnv-gpios is
omitted. This requires very creative use of spi xfers to get the right
signal but does work.

In any case to achieve max sample rate these chips need to use this
"3-wire" mode and have exclusive use of the bus whether is is using
proper CS or not.

So maybe it would be more clear to split this one into two modes?
3-wire with CS and 3-wire without CS?

> 4-write - conventional SPI with CS

Yes.

> chained - the 3 wire mode really but with some timing effects?

Correct. With the exception that the SPI CS line can't be used in
chain mode (unless maybe if you had an inverted CS signal since the
CNV pin has to be high during the data transfer).

> Can we figure out if chained is going on at runtime?

No. We would always need the devicetree to at least say how many chips
are in the chain. Also, in theory, each chip could have independent
supplies and therefore different reference voltages.

Yes, we can do as you suggest. I added this property since I thought
it made things a bit clearer, but apparently not.

Not sure what you mean here, but we can get rid of the adi,reference
property and just add a check to not allow both ref-supply and
refin-supply at the same time.

I explained this above already, but just to have it in context here as
well... In what the datasheet calls "3-wire" mode, we can either have
CS connected and no cnv-gpios or we can have no CS and have cnv-gpios
connected.

So the intention here was to make cnv-gpios required all other modes
but in 3-wire mode, make it optional.
