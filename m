Yeah, kindly read the whole thread. Long story short: Inhibiting _is_ about
ignoring events from inhibited devices. Obviously we can do better than
just that. Indeed, the open() and close() callbacks (which are called at
uninhibiting/inhibiting) mean "start providing events" and "stop providing
events", respectively. How that translates into driver operation is highly
driver-specific and cannot be handled at the input subsystem level, but it
is the place where power savings can be realized: whenever the driver knows
that nobody wants events from it it can do whatever it considers appropriate,
including transitioning the device into low power mode, for example using
PM runtime.

Regards,

Andrzej
