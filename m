I remembered a bit more about this.  INDIO_DIRECT_MODE is used internally
in the state machine for currentmode (now moved to the opaque structure but
accessible via appropriate function). It's there to provide an explicit
state rather than 0 which would be not in a particular state (that I don't
like).  We'd have a somewhat odd (though possible) disconnect if we didn't
have the state in the ->modes bitmask.  (We could reserve the first bit
for example). However I'm still not keen in cleaning it up further.

Either way, we'd still need the various mode setting functions to carry only
doing |= as the driver is permitted to support multiple buffered modes
(unusual, but there are a few drivers doing so IIRC).
