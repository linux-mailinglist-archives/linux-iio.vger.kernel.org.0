Yes... that and we need to send the NOOP command in the second TX
transfer.

Well, _gather_write() are 2 spi transfers only with TX set. That means
that only on the _read() (which will be another spi_message) we will
ask for the data. Im not really sure this would work being it on a
different message. This would also mean, one extra dummy transfer. To
me that already feels that a custom bus implementation is not a bad
idea...

Ok, going a bit back in the discussion, you argued that in one place I
was using long while here u16. Well, in the place I'm using long, that
was on purpose because that value is to be compared against an array of
longs (which has to be long because it depends on CCF rates). I guess I
can als0 use s64, but there is also a reason why long was used.

In the u16 case, we really want to have 2 bytes because I'm going to
use that value to write the dac code which is 2 bytes.

So, to clear....

In your opinion, you are fine whith using device properties and just
have 'to_of_node()' in this CCF call? I'm fine with it, so if Jonathan
does not have any complain about it, will do like this in v4,

Jonathan, any comment on this one?
