whilst not strictly necessary I would prefer we did as it may reduce
storage requirements, computation complexity etc for userspace (particularly
if they are 8 bits).

Would affect scale and shift so slightly more complex, but not a lot
so still a fairly simple change.  Just add resolution to your config
structure and duplicate it where necessary to allow whatever resolutions
we support.

Numeric order preferred. Not sure why these are in the middle.

Andy's comment on using pointers instead follows through to here.
To describe the channels more fully you'll need additional
_config[] structures.
