Would you agree with the attribute adi,current-channel within the channel and
 diff-channels set to the correspondent current inputs (13 10 for pair IN2)?

While re-reading docs I've noticed that AD7176-2 mentions pseudo differential usage:
"Pseudo Differential Inputs
 The user can also choose to measure four different single-ended
 analog inputs. In this case, each of the analog inputs is converted
 as being the difference between the single-ended input to be
 measured and a set analog input common pin. Because there is
 a crosspoint multiplexer, the user can set any of the analog inputs
 as the common pin. An example of such a scenario is to connect
 the AIN4 pin to AVSS or to the REFOUT voltage (that is, AVSS
 + 2.5 V) and select this input when configuring the crosspoint
 multiplexer. When using the AD7176-2 with pseudo differential
 inputs, the INL specification is degraded."

As the crosspoint mux is present on all models it really makes me think that this
paragraph applies to all models in the family

Alright, from my perspective they all pass through the same mux but okay,
not differential. The only issue would differentiating cases in AD4116 where
the pair VIN10 - VINCOM is specified as single-ended or differential pair.

Also, AD4116:
"0101101111 ADCIN11, ADCIN15. (pseudo differential or differential pair)
 0110001111 ADCIN12, ADCIN15. (pseudo differential or differential pair)
 0110101111 ADCIN13, ADCIN15. (pseudo differential or differential pair)
 0111001111 ADCIN14, ADCIN15. (pseudo differential or differential pair)"

Not really sure where the "actual pseudo differential" sits.

Would you agree with having device tree flags that specifies how is the
channel used: single-ended, pseudo-differential, differential.
For the first two, the differential flag will not be set in IIO.

What do you mean by offset? I currently understand that the user will have
a way of reading the voltage of that specific supply from the driver. 

If you mean provide a different channel offset value when using it as
pseudo-differential then I would disagree

I really hope that a clean solution could be obtained for this driver as well :)
