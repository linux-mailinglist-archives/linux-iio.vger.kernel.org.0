The potential issue is that with this userspace code may rely on the common
option (matches device tree node name) and then get confused on it changing.

If it wasn't there previously and appears (which is what happens when
a label is added currently) userspace is unlikely to have in some fashion
depended on it not being there...

If someone modifies an existing label they can reasonably expect to break
compatibility because they made something 'go away'.

Typo in that didn't help. (agnostic).  Anyhow, basically it has to work
for ACPI as well.

It's not unique.  As per https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage,
"sibling nodes are expected to be unique".  If you have multiple
i2c masters and the same device under each of them with the
same i2c address they are not siblings (different parents) and
will have the same node name.

I don't see why we want a default label. If it's not provided it's
not there (no file) and userspace can go use something else for
it's unique naming. Note that for older kernels they need to do
that anyway because label never existed. So userspace will need
to work with possibility of it being absent. As userspace is
going to do that today, why add another option so we have:

1) No label attribute.
2) Label attribute == node name
3) Label attribute something else

vs having to handle 2 cases.

1) No label attribute
2) Label attribute present.

So adding a default makes userspace code more complex, not less.
