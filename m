Hi Jonathan,

This is the V2 of my patchset that introduces a new userspace interface
based on DMABUF objects to complement the fileio API, and adds write()
support to the existing fileio API.

Changes since v1:

- the patches that were merged in v1 have been (obviously) dropped from
  this patchset;
- the patch that was setting the write-combine cache setting has been
  dropped as well, as it was simply not useful.
- [01/12]: 
    * Only remove the outgoing queue, and keep the incoming queue, as we
      want the buffer to start streaming data as soon as it is enabled.
    * Remove IIO_BLOCK_STATE_DEQUEUED, since it is now functionally the
      same as IIO_BLOCK_STATE_DONE.
- [02/12]:
    * Fix block->state not being reset in
      iio_dma_buffer_request_update() for output buffers.
    * Only update block->bytes_used once and add a comment about why we
      update it.
    * Add a comment about why we're setting a different state for output
      buffers in iio_dma_buffer_request_update()
    * Remove useless cast to bool (!!) in iio_dma_buffer_io()
- [05/12]:
    Only allow the new IOCTLs on the buffer FD created with
    IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTL().
- [12/12]:
    * Explicitly state that the new interface is optional and is
      not implemented by all drivers.
    * The IOCTLs can now only be called on the buffer FD returned by
      IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTL.
    * Move the page up a bit in the index since it is core stuff and not
      driver-specific.

The patches not listed here have not been modified since v1.

Cheers,
-Paul
