I'd argue we are after a specific SPI controller setup for this.
A controller driver would need modifying to make it work.

Such functionality would need to be pushed to the spi controller driver
which could know if there was any need to do anything like this, or if there
was simply a register to set.

There is one similar (ish) entry already.
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/spi/spi.h=
#L29
#define	SPI_3WIRE_HIZ		_BITUL(15)	/* high impedance turnaround */
in that it is controlling state in what I think would normally be a don't c=
are state.

I think we could have an
SPI_SDO_DONT_CARE_HIGH (naming to be improved upon ;)=20
that a driver could advertise support for and the spi device could request.

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-=
tpo-tpg110.c#L429

Implement that in the spi-gpio driver as a PoC probably and in your SPI cop=
ntoller
driver.

Ultimately if the controller really isn't capable (including dances through=
 pin
mode changes if necessary) then the ADC won't work in this wiring with that=
 host
controller.

I'd propose something along these lines and see whether Mark + any other ac=
tive
SPI folk think it is reasonable or not?

Fair enough. No multi master support I guess (that is a bit obscure for
SPI).  A little ugly that it's dependent on the last access - so you would =
need
to do a dummy access if the normal last bit was wrong level?
