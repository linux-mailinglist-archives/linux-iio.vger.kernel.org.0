If CONFIG_PM is disabled, do we really need to care about the power
management on removal?

We can add pm_runtime_set_active() before h/w is touched for more
consistency. On Steam Deck supplies are always enabled, but this may be
not true for other devices.

It's appropriate, although caring about PM when it's disabled in kernel
config could be unnecessary, IMO. It was my suggestion to keep the h/w
enabled on driver's removal with !CONFIG_PM, minimizing the code.
