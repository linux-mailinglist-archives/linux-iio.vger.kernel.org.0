Fine, I agree.

I see those options (let me know if you see other options I have not
mentioned):

1. I add this change (taking into account also intel ice) as a separate
   patch in this series and you may just ack it and Greg could merge
   together with the serdev one.
2. I prepare an independent patch for the GNSS change and only once this
   is merged I'll send a rebased v2 of this one.
3. I update this patch without this GNSS API change, that mean I will
   have to cast away the signed type from a few GNSS drivers.

1 is my preferred option, 2 is fine, but it seems a little bit of overdoing,
3 I would avoid, we are doing this cleanup to be a little bit more
strongly typed and to prevent the kind of bugs that is the original trigger
for this patch.

What would you Greg and Johan prefer?

ack, sorry about that, looking back at the archive is seems a recent
pain point, also Jiri fell in this trap.
