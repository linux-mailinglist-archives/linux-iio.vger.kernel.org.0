It would be better, indeed. And to whom it may concern you may add a
comment explaining how 8 is derived.

Thanks, I got it.

OK. Let the maintainer decide.

Yes, you shift zero offset to some value. I see that in several
drivers, so I think it would be nice to have a macro for that
somewhere in math.h. But it can be done later on.

Yes, it needs to be u32_encode_bits(), but in any case it's up to you,
it's not anyhow a critical change.

Confusing part is what dev_err_probe() prints here when ret == 0.
