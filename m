This still has a UB according to the C standard. That's why
BIT()/BIT_ULL() is preferable to use since they don't have such
issues. You may open code it, of course (since I remember you wished
to show that this is not a bit, but a number).

By understanding the C standard? I dunno, actually. GCC will generate
correct code, it's just a special warning you may get when supplying a
parameter (Linux kernel doesn't use that one even on W=2 IIRC).
