Ah. So the structure is used in 2 ways.

1. As a target for DMA, which means it should live in the cacheline we
are saving for that purpsoe.
2. As a place to build up data.  

In general we should be careful with doing 2 as that could race with
DMA and end up with data corruption, however you only use it that
way in flush_fifo where both the DMA and this usage under under 
the mutex.  Hence I think you are fine.

Ok.  That's unusual so good to know.

That's a good reason. Just add a comment to that say that.

Understood. I looked it up too before suggesting this local hack.
You'll still need a custom regmap, but at least this trick would
allow you to avoid allocating a buffer in the read function.
