I've moved them all to debugfs, but I think this is abusing what debugfs
is for. It may not be mounted on a system after all.

Why not have a namespace in sysfs for things specific to a device that
can't be abstracted to other devices?

zpos/mpos define an arc in the circle. Physically that could reflect a
rotating button that can't do full circles. I've documented that a bit in v2.

I'm unclear how MANG works, as I haven't been able to set it. My only option 
would be to flash it (OTP) it to a value to my only device.

I left that in place, since I think it could be possible for the magnet to
not be present when the driver loads, for instance some sort of door could be
opened. Also it doesn't break anything besides not returning an valid angle.
