Hi William. Thank you for your help.
Yes, your understanding of how this device behaves is correct.

Yes, that would work for my needs.
The "how" is not fully clear to me yet, since I never used counter 
subsystem. But the
best way to understand better how it works is probably to start working 
with it. :-)
So, next patch version will be based on counter subsystem.
