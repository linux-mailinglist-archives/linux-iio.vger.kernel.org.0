Should have said receive 'something' - that means that we'd clock some data
whether or not the device had any to provide.

+CC Mark.  Discussion is about whether a zero length SPI transfer is guaran=
teed
to pulse the chip select.

If this is something we need, I'd prefer to see it as something a given SPI
controller would opt in to supporting or some other way of knowing it would
actually happen such as some docs that say it will work for an SPI controll=
er
(which I doubt is the case)
