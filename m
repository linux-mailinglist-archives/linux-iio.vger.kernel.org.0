There is no dedicated register for that, but it would be possible to 
expose this value
(when interruptions are triggered, we would just need to parse flags 
1/2/3/4 to determine
mod4 counter current state). That would not be very useful, though.

I prefer using only 1 signal if you don't mind. I think it's less 
confusing for the user.
