There is no such thing as driver compatible, in the terms of Devicetree.
Implementation does not matter. The compatibles and binding should
reflect the hardware (and its programming model).

The question is - whether the programming model (e.g. all I2C registers)
are similar or exactly the same?

Yes, it is not desired because any probe failure is indication of test
failures in automated systems, so you do not develop a system which in
normal conditions has a failure.

I don't understand why you cannot include in this driver support for
second device?
Or if second device is so different, why you want to support different
hardware with the same device node. This contradicts the very basic of
Devicetree - description of hardware.
