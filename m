No problem. But I suggest you CC the IIO mail list when sending this 
kind of questions. It may be the messages where the list is not in CC 
are regarded as spam by my mail filters... Besides, others with more 
insight to IIO may be able to further help you when the list is CC'd ;)

Oh, thanks for contacting me :) So, you have the sensor hardware at your 
hands? I think this is mandatory when writing a driver.

Yes and no :) There is a kernel driver which supports many of the kx* 
accelerometers in the ROHM downstream Linux-Kernel-Input-Drivers, and I 
believe it also supports the KX132/KX134. Yet, as the name suggests - 
these drivers are not exposing the accelerometer using IIO but the INPUT 
subsystem. Reason is that quite a few device manufacturers still use the 
accelerometers via HAL written on top of the INPUT. Heikki Haikola (in 
CC) has authored many of these drivers. The INPUT is not the preferred 
subsystem for acceleromerers though - so you're correct when planning to 
write an IIO driver for upstream.

Upstream support for (ROHM or any other) ICs is very welcome. It enables 
more and more people to benefit from the ICs. Companies can rarely 
support small customers and open source drivers make it possible for the 
people to work without this support :) This work has been on my TODO 
list since I added KX022A driver - but it has had low priority and I 
seem to always have some other tasks. So, Your work on these ICs is more 
than welcome!

> Iâ€™m eager to receive your feedback! (and sorry for the long text)

It was not too long :)

If you wish to proceed with the driver, then I would have couple of 
suggestions to you. As far as I remember the KX132 is not really _that_ 
different from the KX022A. Sure the resolution is different as may be 
the G-ranges. But the logic of the register interface is largely same. I 
suggest you to study the possibility of extending the KX022A driver to 
support the other variants. I would differentiate the IC types based on 
device-tree and fill in the register offsets/required quirks in the 
driver private data.

The other suggestion from me is that you could check the IC's logic from 
the Linux-Kernel-Input-Drivers. I think there were some minor 
differencies in the behaviour for example when the BUFE or PC1 bits are 
toggled.

Feel free to ask us if you hit to problems with the work, but please 
note that most of us in Finland are having a holiday season right now - 
so many of us will be offline until January.

Yours,
	-- Matti
