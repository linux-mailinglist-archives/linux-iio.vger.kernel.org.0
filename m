Best effort + in general if we do something probe(), we want to do the
reverse in remove().  Sure it's not super important, but it's a nice
to have.  This tends to get 'fixed' by people revisiting the driver
after it has merged.

Generally set it wherever you 'enable' the device as you are indicating
the state after that has happened. That might be really early though.

For the cost of about 4-8 lines of code, I think it's worth having, but can
also see why you decided against.
