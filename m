Yes. As I said, I think the reverse xmas tree rule is not too well 
justified. Bunch of the subsystems do not really follow it, nor did this 
function. Yet, as I said, I can move the array to the first line in the 
function when I respin the series..

Just wanted to correct - it was Sebastian Reichel, not Guenter who 
explained me why doing local static const arrays is better than plain const.

Maybe the explanation by Sebastian here can put us on the same page:

I don't see how moving something from a local block to a global scope 
does make conflicts less of an issue? On the contrary, it makes things 
worse as then the moved variable will collide with any other variable in 
any of the functions in the whole file. Having the array as function 
local static makes the naming collisions to be issue only if another 
global variable has the same name. And if that happened - the chances 
are code would still be correct as the function here is clearly intended 
to use the local one. If someone really later adds a global with the 
same name - and uses the global in this function - then he should have 
noted we have local variable with same name. Additionally - such user 
would be using terribly bad name for a global variable.

Please note that scope of the function local static variable is limited 
to function even if the life-time is not just the life-time of a function.

Sorry, I really don't agree with your reasoning here. :(
