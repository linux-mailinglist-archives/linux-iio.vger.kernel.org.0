I had a go below. Not trivial but may still be worth doing.  It seems to be linear
though the maths is a bit nasty!  This depends on that fab_coeff() returning
a constant value for a particular part which I haven't checked.

calibbias is usually an internal tweak factor that in hardware corrects for
inaccuracies - something like a DAC tweaking something in the analog front end.

Here it doesn't feel like it's useful to expose a software tweak to userspace
as it would have no idea what to do with it.

Set channel and indexed for the channel. You should have in_temp0_raw, in_temp1_raw etc
Extend name was never meant to replace the index as it isn't visible in things
like event codes if you ever need to implement that stuff.  So they should all
have and unique index values anyway.

So I think this is: 

([fab_offset - (adc_code * FS_N )/ (FS_DEN * MAX_VAL)] * MILI / fab_slope + offset

Let A= FS_N/(FS_N * MAX_VAL)
    B = MILLI/fab_slope

= (fab_ofset - adc_code * A)*B + offset
= [((fab_offset / A - adc_code)*A + (offset / B)] * B
= [fab_offset/A - adc_code + offset / AB] * AB
= [adc_code - fab_offset/A - offset/AB]* -AB
= (a + offset) * scale)

where a is the adc_code,
offset = - fab_offset * FS_N * MAX_VAL/ FS_N - offset * FS_N * MAX_VAL * fab_slow / (MILLI  * FS_N)
scale = (FS_N * MILLI) / (FS_N * MAX_VAL * FAB_SLOPE)

So I think it can can done.  Quest then becomes whether sufficient precision can be
maintained for it to make sense to do the fixed point maths in the kernel to establish
those two coefficients and push it out to userspace as a constant that can then be
applied to the channel.

Note this assume that rradc_get_fab_coeff() returns a fixed value for a given device.
