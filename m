I have taken a look at quiet a few light sensor drivers including
apds9960 and apds9300, as you said that they are different. There are
another two drivers apds990x and apds9802als in drivers/misc which are
also very different but I can't say that I have been through all the
driver files.

Yes, processed = (raw + offset) * scale. No need to do calculations in kernel
space. Ok. I will reimplement it.

I'll put it in the next version.

Well, regarding device access, interrupt handler just reads the status registers
thereby clearing the interrupt status flag and releasing the physical interrupt line.
What can be the issue if I don't use a lock?

Right. I will do a bit more reading on this before using this. I assumed this
functions registers the callback which gets called at driver release by the
subsystem similar to release().

Yes, true. Real regs are available why use fake ones. I'll fix it.

Thank you Jonathan for the review. I'll get the changes done in the next version.
