Thanks Rob,

Whether this makes it for this cycle is probably dependent on whether
Linus does decide to do got to rc8 as hinted at as a possibility
+ whether Greg feels comfortable taking these through his tree
(char-misc is the normal path for IIO).  I know various people
are hoping this series makes it, but if doesn't we can do an immutable
tree early next cycle (though obviously that may reduce speed of adoption).

We are discussing the equivalent pull request for the fwnode version here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/2024030239-gift-cabdriver-266b@gregkh/T/#m87e7208820ebf6416a77a2973773b65a087b4796

I've optimistically applied this series to my togreg-cleanup branch
and merged that into the togreg branch of iio.git for linux-next to pick up.

Thanks,

Jonathan
