*laughs*  you caught be avoiding thinking about how we might do this.  Going to need
some new ABI that can be universal or per event.

I think the best bet is probably to define something similar to adaptive_thresh in
that we are saying it's a threshold / magnitude as appropriate but not on the
raw underlying signal.  We could potentially use adaptive again but maybe we need
something more specific as that is used when the threshold tracks some low pass
filtered version of the signal. Perhaps

in_accel_x_referenced_magn_* with appropriate ABI docs that make it clear that for
acceleration the point is to remove G, but leave it open what referenced might mean
for other types of signal.

Well for what we have today it would be IIO_EV_TYPE_MAG. Roughly speaking
(there are varriants that are similar enough we don't distinguish).
IIO_EV_TYPE_THRESH is signed comparison. If you happen to have a signal that
is always positive (e.g. an ADC) then it's preferred of IIO_EV_TYPE_MAGN even
though they would be the same thing.

So if you have an accelerometer that does -10m/sec^2 to 10m/sec^2 a
rising threshold detector at 5m/sec^2 would only trigger when we pass 
5m/sec^2 heading upwards towards 6, but not when passing -5m/sec^2 heading
for -6m/sec^2.

Magn is basically a threshold applied to the absolute of the reading so a
rising magn threshold would fire on both passing 5m/sec^2 heading for 6m/sec^2
and on passing -5m/sec^2 heading for -6m/sec^2.

The adaptive variants are more fun in that rather than applying to the raw
signal they 'typically' apply relative to some filtered version of that raw
signal (normally Low pass filtered).  The idea is to detect a sudden absolute
change but ignore a slow drift.  So filter on signal - LowPass(signal) with
same thresh vs magn rules as above.
