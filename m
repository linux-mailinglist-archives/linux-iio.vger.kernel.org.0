Exactly  - my main interest is the dream of getting to the point where
new drivers typically also come with roadtest tests, with the aim that
they will be used for regression testing. For IIO I might lean on
/ ask nicely  few of the bigger contributors to add fairly comprehensive
tests for say one in 3 of their drivers, providing a canary for any
subsystem level problems that might sneak in. The stability gained for
those drivers might also prove it's own benefit to push people to add tests.
At somepoint in the longer term I might even make it a requirement for
upstreaming a new driver + slowly tackle the backlog of existing ones.

I fully appreciate your concern.  I just really like roadtest and want
a smooth way to integrate using it with my upstream maintenance (and occasi=
onal
development) process...  I of course can't expect you to commit to anything
though - I'd be delighted if someone else wants to take this forwards but
that would be very much their decision to make!

Having not yet waded into the latest code, how 'stable' is it from the point
of view of modifications to tests?  I can rebase the ones I have out of tree
and see, but I'm after an assessment that incorporates what you are
planning to change in future.

I guess the nasty stuff is if you have a few hundred additional drivers
in the test set, any modification to the way they interact with the core
of roadtest becomes very painful to push into those tests.

One starting point would be to separate the tests directory from the
directories containing roadtest frameworks etc as that would help to
limit scope of responsibility.

If a potential upstream roadtest maintainer is primarily concerned about
review + handling of the actual tests, other than potentially letting in
some ugly code, I'd imagine any subsystem maintainer who opts into this
will take that burden on - perhaps with the occasional question heading
your way. I'd certainly not expect you to have to deal with high patch flows
and would ensure that didn't happen for any IIO tests (any review people
have time for is of course welcome!)

+CC a few maintainers of other subsystems who may be interested (I know
one of them is ;)
