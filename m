Hi Quentin,

Wow. The datasheet description of this very confusing...
One key thing is we need to be careful of is that tilt (x/y is
not always available - but rather shows the last, and probably
now garbage, value)

I assume facing up vs facing down?  User might be lying on their
back in which case this description doesn't work.  The datasheet
also talks about the case where g lies near the XY plane and hence
the z axis is horizontal.

I think you need to deal with BIT(7) as well.

Don't define the shift, you can use FIELD_GET(MASK, val)

In event of tilt not being set (BIT (7)) I think you should return an error
code here.  -EBUSY perhaps? To reflect the fact we don't have valid data.

Documentation for this is really confusing, as it refers to a circumstance
when it can be assumed to be horizontal, but then doesn't define it.

It might be a simple as tilt being set and thus indicating significant
acceleration due to gravity in the xy plane.
However, the Z orientation is still updated in that case...

Hmm.  Should this be rotation or inclination (so referenced
to gravity).  Inclination is not particularly tightly defined but the
point is that it is relative to gravity - kind of a special case of
rot.

For the adis16209 we handled inclination and rotation.  I think rotation
in that device corresponds to XY here. (though it's oddly defined for
X axis, whereas I'm fairly sure it should be Z - as rotation 'about'
z axis). The Z one here should I think be an inclination because it's not
about any particular axis.

We also have angle to confuse matters. In that case intent was 'between'
two things. Arguably all the uses of rot are as well, just that one of those
things is gravity or magnetic north.  With hindsight I think we could have
gotten away with one of them, but hard to tidy up now.

In conclusion, what you have here I think is best described as
IIO_ROT about Z axis (the XY one)
and IIO_INCL for the Z axis (the Z one).
