This was a suggestion from Jonathan, maybe I implemented it wrong.
Other alternative that came to my mind: attribute "adi,current-channel".

It would mean for the user to look in the datasheet at the possible
channel INPUT configurations values, decode the bit field into two
integer values and place it here (0110101010) -> 13 10. This is
cumbersome for just choosing current input 2.

Sure, I'll rename to VINCOM.

I cannot see any configuration options for these use cases. All inputs
are routed to the same mux and routed to the differential positive and
negative ADC inputs.

"VIN10, VINCOM (single-ended or differential pair)" the only difference
between these two use cases is if you connected VINCOM to AVSS (with
unipolar coding) or not with bipolar encoding. The channel is still
measuring the difference between the two selected inputs and comparing
to the selected reference.

I cannot seem to understand what would a adcin15-supply be needed for.
This input, the same as all others, enters the mux and is routed to
either positive or negative input of the ADC.

The voltage on the ADCIN15 pin is not important to the user, just the
difference in voltage between that pin and the other one selected.

Other way around, forgot in a previous patch to remove the comment.
I'll move this change to a precursor patch.

We'll see what is the best approach regarding the current channels,
perhaps the one you mentioned in the later reply with always configuring
like the temp channel.

It is addressed already in the binding:
"
  - if:
      properties:
        compatible:
          contains:
            const: adi,ad7172-4

"
