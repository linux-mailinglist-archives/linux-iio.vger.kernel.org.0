Why? OF won't be used at all.

It's not bad, but I think that division between register and value is a good
thing to have.

Would be nice!

Hmm... It was some time I have looked there. Any message ID to share, so
I can find it quickly?

This is about consistency. It may work as is, but it feels not good when for
int (or unsigned int) one uses fixed-width types. Also it's non-written advice
to use fixed-width variables when it's about programming registers or so, for
the rest, use POD types.

Ah, okay, would be a limitation for non-OF platforms.

That's fine, since CCF is OF-centric API.

Why? This header doesn't bring anything you will use here.

It's a good idea for sensors to be able to use them outside of OF platforms.
CCF is PITA, but at least with the conversion to device property API, this
become the only one (and it has a few possible workarounds).

__clear_bit().
