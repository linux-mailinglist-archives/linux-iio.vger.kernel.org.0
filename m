At somepoint we'll just have to decide it's enough. To be honest most
drivers in IIO get testing along those lines and we find bugs years
later when someone tries something a little different!

Stick to rc1 though I doubt it makes much difference. The IIO tree
will remain based on v6.6-rc1 until it is rebased after Greg takes
a pull request.
