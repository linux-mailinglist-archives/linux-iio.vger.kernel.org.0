After the series converting over most of the cases this patch set touched
in IIO, I have 

rcar-gyroadc and the unit test left, which are enough to show the purpose
of the patch and put a few real users in place.

Will submit a v2 with just those 2 users.  Ideal would be to get these in
for the merge window so it is available for other subsystems next cycle.
