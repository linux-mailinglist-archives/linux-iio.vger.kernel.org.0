Hi Iain,

A few comments in addition to those Rob sent.
It's worth noting that there is a lot of 'history' in IIO bindings so
sometimes copying stuff from an existing binding is no longer the way
things should be done.

No.  Should be some sort of index value. If I recall correctly, existing use is reg == channel
number when single ended and more loosely defined for differential.  In many cases first of the
pair, but that's not always guaranteed to be unique (e.g. 0-1 and 0-3 in this case).

This is a new binding, so how can we have deprecated properties?
Also seems very odd indeed to have a list of channels defined inside a per channel node.

Can this use diff-channels in the standard adc binding:

This should be a pair based constraint as not all options possible. Something like
          oneOf:
            - items:
                - const: 0
                - const: 1
            - items:
                - enum: [0, 1, 2]
		- const: 3

More recent approach to this is the one you've used for differential channels
- 1 child node per channel.

The SPI0 vs 1 is correctly not part of this example, so drop that from
the comment.

This doesn't obey the schema you have above at all. Would looks something like
               channel@0 {
                 diff-channels = <0 3>;
               }
