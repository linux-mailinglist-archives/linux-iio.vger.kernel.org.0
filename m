Hi Fabrice,

I took a look the stm32-timer-trigger.c file, but I'm having trouble
understanding it well (probably the cascading is confusing me). If I
understand the logic correctly, the user selects the trigger they want
by the attribute's name which is compared via strncmp() against the
'valids' table. It's possible we could dynamically configure the signal
names, but keep the signal id static so the driver code won't need some
many variations; alternatively, we could introduce a new signal
extension attribute that could display the trigger name.

Would you walk me through an example of using the stm32-timer-trigger
IIO sysfs interface? I think that would help me understand how users
currently interact with the triggers for that driver, and then maybe I
can figure out an appropriate equivalent in the Counter paradigm for
the migration. Right now, the timer cascade is confusing me so if I can
grok it well, the right solution for this may come to me more easily.

Thanks,

William Breathitt Gray
