Based on my current understanding what we have here is not remotely
generic, so standard properties don't make sense (though naming the
nxp ones in a consistent fashion with other bindings is useful)

I'm not entirely convinced there is a strong argument to support them at all
though.  Still thinking / gathering info on that.

Generally we don't make strong efforts to support dev board use cases where
the components wired tend to change.  So normally this isn't too much of
a concern.  Previously, we've tried to support this stuff and it always
ends up as a mess because of the crazy range of things that can be wired.
