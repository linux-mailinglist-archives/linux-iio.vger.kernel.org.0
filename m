I don't think it's an either/or thing in terms of approach here - we
need a range of options to choose from.  ACPI is totally fine and solves
real problems for the systems it targets, the problems we see with it
are mainly that it has a very strong system abstraction and doesn't cope
well when things go outside that coupled with the fact that Windows long
ago decided that board files were totally fine for papering over any
problems so people haven't worked on standardisation where they should.
Some SoCs like to do similar things with their power controller cores.

Conversely for example with many (but not all) SoC IPs the mechanics of
the system integration and range of options available are such that
dealing with them is kind of out of scope of the driver, but they're
often very repetitive over any given SoC so there is a benefit in
pushing things into power domains rather than having the driver for the
IP manage everything.  We need to be able to be flexible so we can find
the best idioms to represent the different systems in front of us rather
than trying to force all systems into a single idiom.

Sometimes it's totally fine to not worry, at least at a first pass.
Perhaps you're more concerned with real time, perhaps your system
doesn't provide control for the relevant resources.  Sometimes the
savings are so negligable that it's questionable if doing the power
manageement is an overall power saving.

TBH I think the problem you have here is with devm not with this
particular function.  That's a different conversation, and a totally
valid one especially when you start looking at things like implementing
userspace APIs which need to cope with hardware going away while still
visible to userspace.  It's *probably* more of a subsystem conversation
than a driver one though, or at least I think subsystems should try to
arrange to make it so.
