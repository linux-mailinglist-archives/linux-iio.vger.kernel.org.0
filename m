Subject: [PATCH 00/16] Bring software triggers support to MAX1027-like ADCs
Date:   Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:11:23 +0200

Until now the max1027.c driver, which handles 10-bit devices (max10xx)
and 12-bit devices (max12xx), only supported hardware triggers. When a
hardware trigger is not wired it is very convenient to trigger periodic
conversions with timers or on userspace demand with a sysfs
trigger. Overall, when several values are needed at the same time using
triggers and buffers improves quite a lot the performances.

This series starts with two small fixes, then does a bit of
cleaning/code reorganization before actually adding support for software
triggers.

This series has been developed and tested on a custom board with a 4.14
kernel. I then rebased the series on top of a mainline kernel
(v5.14-rc1) but unfortunately after quite some time debugging it I was
unable to get all the necessary blocks running in order to properly test
it. Anyway, there was very little changes in that series when rebasing
it from v4.14 to v5.14-rc1 so I am pretty confident it will smoothly
work with a more recent kernel.

How to test sysfs triggers:
    echo 0 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio_sysfs_trigger/add_trigger
    cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio_sysfs_trigger/trigger0/name > \
        /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/trigger/current_trigger
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/scan_elements/in_voltageX_en
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/scan_elements/in_voltageY_en
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/buffer/enable
    cat /dev/iio\:device0 > /tmp/data &
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/trigger0/trigger_now
    od -t x1 /tmp/data

Cheers,
