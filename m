Good find on the bug, but the fix is wrong even if it squashes the error.

s64 as internal kernel type.
More importantly needs to be at least s64 buf[2]; as the offset
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/iio/buffer.h#L41
will be 1 due to this filling the timestamp in at first 8 byte aligned location
after the data that is already in the buffer.

With hindsight was a bad decision a long time ago not to force people to also
pass the size into this function so we could detect this at runtime at least.
Hard to repair now give very large number of drivers using this and the fact
that it's not always easy to work out that size.  Unfortunately occasionally
one of these slips through review :(

I suppose we could, in some cases check if the buffer was at least 16 bytes which
would get us some of the way.
