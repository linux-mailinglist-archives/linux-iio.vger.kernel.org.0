Notably the whole events API :l

I would really like for this to "just work" if at all possible, so an
opt-out would be preferable. Maybe a hwmon module parameter.

But I think we can do better:

- Both kernel/userspace can/should handle unexpected events
  - This includes extra (synthetic) events.
- Both kernel/userspace mostly just want to enable events
- Disabling events is not as important because of the previous bullet.
- But losing events is probably bad so we want to ensure we trigger
  events at the same places they would have been triggered before.

So maybe we have an implementation where

- Enabling an event disables the backing event before re-enabling it if
  there are any existing users
- Disabling an event only disables the backing event if all users are
  gone

It could look something like

iio_sysfs_event_set(event, val):
    if val:
        if !event.user_enable
            disable(event)
        enable(event)
    else if !event.kernel_enables
        disable(event)
    event.user_enable = val

iio_inkern_event_set(event, val):
    if val:
        if event.kernel_enables++ || event.user_enable
            disable(event)
        enable(event)
    else if !--event.kernel_enables && !event.user_enable:
        disable(event)
