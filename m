Great explanation. Perhaps we can capture some of it either as comments,
or patch description etc.

Sure, that might work ok. It's a bit of a hack, but would let you keep the
more interesting stuff hidden way in one place.

I suspected as much. If so, a bunch of this makes not sense. Channels that
can't be in that buffer have magic scan_index = -1 and .scan_type is
probably not used (occasionally it is helpful for non buffered paths, though
rarely all the info in there).

If those fail, don't register the channel.  It should just be invisible
to userspace / in kernel consumers.  That may require reorganizing how
you register channels to know if these worked or not before the
point of registering channels.
