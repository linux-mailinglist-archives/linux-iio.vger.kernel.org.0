To touch back on this, I'm still not sure what your intent was in suggesting
having the explicit struct device_node *

You have to do that in order to ensure there is no window for someone to
easily insert code that leaves them uninitialized.

Linus had some rather specific comments on that being the only right way to
do it.

I picked a couple from the end.  They show the sort of things that
would want cleaning up.  The script is great for finding low hanging
fruit but as you've identified there is often some stuff that isn't
easy to automate.

As below needs to be 
	struct device_node *root __free(device_node) = of_find_node_by_path("/");
so there is no space for code to be added inbetween that might return before
this is set.

This one looks dangerous because of the chance of other code
getting added between here and the point where it is set.

Better to move that down so we have

struct device_node *np __free(device_node) = of_find_node_by_type(NULL, "open-pic");

Also there is a nicer use in:

With root covered this can return early.
