I guessed so.

Make sense.

Since this is just one patch, I can pull in the immutable branch if you
could share and then Cristian can make appropriate changes needed for his
series on top of that unless you want to merge 30+ patches that I might
have with Cristain series ðŸ˜‰.

In short I am happy to pull in your immutable branch and I agree 5.12-rc1
is sensible base.
