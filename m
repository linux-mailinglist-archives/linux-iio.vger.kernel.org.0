I agree.

However on the other hand, since we stumbled upon a use-case that
requires adjusting the driver provided default settings of the i.MX93
ADC, this TODO to us is and was a clear indication from the original
author that the driver needs little TLC.

Anyhow, a stance from the author/NXP would be highly welcoming in this
situation.
