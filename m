I don't understand it either.

Yes, the documentation says that the error should be cleared, but it's
unclear why the driver is expected to do it.  From the documentation it
looks the driver is supposed to choose between pm_runtime_set_active()
and pm_runtime_set_suspended() to clear the error, but how/why is this
choice supposed to be made in the driver when the driver doesn't know
more than the framework about the status of the device?

Perhaps Rafael can shed some light on this.

I guess this is also a question for Rafael.

Even if the error recording is removed from runtime_resume and only done
on suspend failures, all these drivers still have the problem of not
clearing the error, since the next resume will fail if that is not done.
