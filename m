Only Faithful Believe.

How are you? Hope everything goes well.

Although I am not comfortable to send this proposal to you because of increase in SCAM and FRAUD especially in Africa. It's my pleasure to brief you with this. I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, I want to tell you this because I don't have any other option than to tell you as I was touched to open up to you, I married to Mr.Sangoule Godooi who was exporter of Gold from Burkina Faso mining to worldwide for ten years before he died in the year 2010.We were married for 16 years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only six days. Since his death I decided not to remarry, when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$ 8.5M (eight million five hundred united dollars) in bank and presently this money is still in bank, He made this money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining to worldwide.

Recently, I suffer from throat cancer terminally ill. My Doctor told me that I am condemned to certain death due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness .Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

As soon a s I receive your reply I will instruct the Bank Manger to immediately transfer you the fund.
I await your prompt reply.Please send the following: Reply To This E-mail Address msluizagodoi99@yahoo.com

Yours sincerely.

Mrs. Luiza Godooi
