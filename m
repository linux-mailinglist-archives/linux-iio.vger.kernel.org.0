This is for the regulator API, it's mainly for off SoC devices so it's
not a question of understanding the integration of a device into a piece
of silicon, it's a question of understanding the integration of a chip
into a board which seems reasonably in scope for a chip driver and is
certainly the sort of thing that you'd be talking to your customers
about as a silicon vendor.

That is a sensible approach for most on SoC things but for something
shipped as a separate driver there's little point in separating the
power and clocking domain driver from the device since there's typically
a 1:1 mapping.  Usually either it's extremely simple (eg, turn
everything on and remove reset) but some devices really need to manage
things.  There's obviously some edge cases in SoC integration as well
(eg, the need to manage card supplies for SD controllers, or knowing
exact clock rates for things like audio controllers) so you need some
flex.
