Yes, this is a style issue and not a real coding problem. As a
reviewer with some of a background I feel that reversed xmas tree
ordering is better to read, maintain, and review. So, as a reviewer I
have an opinion, as a maintainer I can speak for the IIO subsystem,
since it's not on my watch.

Yes, and it's irrelevant to what I'm trying to tell you.

SInce it's static it's global by nature, but local by namespace.

And I have no other words to explain it to you. You are using a global
variable in the scope of function. This is not good for the
maintenance and development as it's prone to get an issue in the
future.

Because they are on the stack and not one per module. When you read
the code it's very easy to miss that the variable is static if you
have a lot of other variables defined.

It won't be created by function, it's created by the compiler /
linker. It won't gone if function gone. e.g.

__init foo()
{
  static bar ...;
}

is nonsense. And it takes a ROM space.

...


To summarize, we have a huge disagreement on the placement of the
static variables. Not sure we ever get into compromize here, so I
leave it up to maintainers, but my opinion that it is simply a bad
code practice.
