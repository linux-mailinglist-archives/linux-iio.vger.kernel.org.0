A few follow up comments on your David's review
Anything I deleted didn't need a comment as all made sense to me!

Yes. For these docs I'd not mention it. New software should be aware of multiple
buffers being possible and not use it. Same is true of the scan_elements directory.
If we really want to mention it, say buffer/ and scan_elements are for backwards
compatibility and should not be used in new userspace software.

They aren't going anywhere, but better people start from a multibuffer world!

Be careful to not refer to matching.  Could be a subset.  I'd refer to
"an unsupported combination of channels" or something like that.

Yes - unsigned would be my preference.

Agreed - the padding is sometimes not what people expect.

Definitely by far the most common case but there are a few exceptions where
there isn't a _raw attribute but only an _input one where the assumption is
processed data.  Tricky to mention that here without adding complexity.
Maybe just add some weasel words to hint there are corners not covered by
this doc.

I'd not do that until we have a section for these docs on dma buffers which
are different in a bunch of ways. Would just be a potential source of
confusion.
