Hi William,

Sorry for the long delay to address your comments here. Many thanks for
these guidelines.

I'm preparing a v3, to address these. I'll probably send it soon, so we
can start to review also the capture part of it. Still there are few
things here I'm wondering about (as an anticipation task).

Basically, removing all the diversity here means the most featured timer
model will be represented here (with all possible signals).
When I wrote the various configuration arrays, I'd have been tempted to
allocate them dynamically upon probing to avoid having all these
variants described as const arrays. This may have eased other signals
additions later. But that's not the direction. So, this simplifies the
description here, clearly, to describe the full-featured timer/counter,
and handle the ("unconnected") variants by returning errors.

I still have in mind the replacement of the last IIO_COUNT device [1]
(not addressed in this series), e.g. in
drivers/iio/trigger/stm32-timer-trigger.c. Here, there are
"valids_table" that are used to cascade two timers (one timer output
being the input to another timer). With this table currently, an IIO
user knows the name of the signal it selects (then the driver looks up
the 'valids' table to set SMCR / TS bits, e.g. trigger select). Each
individual timer has a different input mapping, so called peripheral
interconnect in STM32.
What bothers me here is: with an abstracted full-featured timer, without
any diversity on the signal names, I fear the userland has no clue on
which signal would be used. Abstracting the timer this way would mean
the user only knows it selects "Internal Trigger 0" for example, without
knowing which internal signal in the SoC it has selected.

Even if this is out of scope for this series, would you have some clue
so I can anticipate it ? Or if we stick with abstract names? In which
case the userland may need to be aware of the signals mapping (where
currently in IIO_COUNT driver, the signal names are privided). I'd be
glad to get some direction here.

Please advise,
Best Regards,
Fabrice
