A quick update to my previous feedback:
As you mentioned it in the converter fw serie, 
component_compare_fwnode() and component_release_fwnode() patch is not 
included. By default I used the component_release_of() and 
component_compare_of() from the component API. This was not the best 
idea. With a correct compare function the init callbacks are actually 
called. So, no real issue here :-)
