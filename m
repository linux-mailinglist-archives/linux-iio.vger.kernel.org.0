Hi M=C3=A5rten,

Agree with your reasoning etc (and I guess you've triggered this for real)
so just a few patch description etc comments.

I think the following example could be clearer. I haven't checked
the naming of states in runtime pm, but a few things seem backwards to me.

It triggers a timeout to do runtime suspend if no access in 2000ms, not res=
ume.

suspend timeout hasn't yet run out, so the runtime pm subsystem thinks the
device is still powered up and doesn't need resuming.

suspend timeout.=20

Fixes tag - probably 2 of them. One for the recent change that added
the || als_int part and one for wherever the bug originally came from
with comments to say why there are two fixes tags.

This will need manual backporting as this line changed recently and I'm fai=
rly
sure the argument is equally valid for the older code.
