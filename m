Hi David,

I'm fine with carrying these docs in staging, but I think we need to resolve
mapping as many of these as possible to standard ABI if we can for
all the normal reasons about software having no idea how to deal
with custom ABI.

Anyhow, I'll use this as an opportunity to comment on the individual
files.

I mention in the cover letter, but I wonder if we can map this to a threshold
on a differential channel between the cosine and sine channels (use labels for
the channels to identify them). It's a stretch but perhaps better than
completely custom as at least we have event tooling to read it.

If nothing else we need these to have standard units and the
unit to be obvious from the name.  Voltages in IIO are mV (because
we copied hwmon a long time back)

Not clear what this actually is to me, but it's a threshold on something!
Probably two channels which is always a pain as we'll have indicate two events
if they are enabled.

No idea what this one is.  What does 'reset' have to do with it?
Ah I went and looked.  This is the reset value used for the running maximum / minimum
values.  They matter because they fault detection is difference between the values
and if we say init the minimum to lower than actually seen that will make the
error more likely (I think!).

So not sure what we map this to.  Maybe this just has to be custom ABI but
it should be associated with the threshold event - though I'd not registered
that's on a running minimum and maximum rather than some 'windowed' version
for recent values...

This fails the sniff test for a sysfs attribute giving multiple things.
If we do use this sort of reporting rather than an event, maybe a fault
directory (sysfs group) with 8 files in it.

Hmm. I though we already had this.  Turns up in various types of device.
But nope, can't find it.  I'm fine with this one being added to the main ABI.

For what it's worth Phases in IIO (phase_raw in ABI docs) are defined
in radians so this will want to be appropriately scaled if we keep it around.

This one feels like a threshold on phase which is already in the IIO ABI
(for 3 phase power monitors IIRC)
