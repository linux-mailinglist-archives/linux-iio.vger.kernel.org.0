I know that, I've written enough of that type of code ;)

I meant a way to avoid having to go open each evdev, read its
capabilities, and close them when it doesn't, and re-do that every time
a new event device appears. In other words, can you please make sure
there will be a udev property that we can use to enumerate and filter
devices with those capabilities?

So we'll need a way to know what wireless device is inside the laptop
so that policy only applies to that one. This was already fun when it
was just event devices that needed grouping ;)
