If burst readings do make sense: We can reasonably assume anyone who is usi=
ng
this sensor and is using buffered mode probably wants to 'mostly' grab all =
the
channels, then a specific function that always grabs them all, plus use of
available_scan_masks =3D { ALL BITS, 0 }; will let the IIO core deal with a=
ny
cases where only some channels are requested.  This is something we
do in drivers where there is some interaction between the channels (like he=
re)
or where burst reads are much more efficient than single channels (possibly
also true here) and complexity is significant for switching between burst
and single channels reads.

That covers a lot of devices and is part of why we have the core code
do channel de-multiplexing rather than leaving it for the drivers. The other
reason that drove that complexity was unrelated to this driver (SoC ADCs wi=
th
some channels used for touchscreens, and others for unrelated purposes).

You may just want to reduce how much code you are reusing from
the oneshot single channel sysfs reads so that you can just do a single set
of readings and use them as needed for compensation etc.
