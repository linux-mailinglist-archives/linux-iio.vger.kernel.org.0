Agreed. iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() is only suitable for use with
either edge triggered or pulse type interrupts (which are basically edges
as well).  The interrupt handler should not be simply returning IRQ_HANDLED if there
is a need to disable / mask the interrupt (which there always is for a level
interrupt).

Makes sense.

Lets go with sort of for that - they are conceptually different interrupts,
but the top half of the pollfunc runs directly from the iio_trigger_poll call
as well masking the downstream interrupts and kicking off their threads.

Key here is that the top IRQ handler is return IRQ_HANDLED so that stuff
is all irrelevant - the interrupt is unmasked.

One common approach is to mask the interrupt at source if that's possible
(or at destination in worst case).  The triggers have a reenable that
is then called only once all downstream consumers have handled a trigger
- that is used to then unmask the interrupt at source.  Here the challenge
is that overlaps with reading the register.  We tend to cheat a bit when
this happens and either not have a reenable callback or have one that
reads the register again (to support other consumers of this trigger if
this device isn't consuming it's own trigger).

An Ack before reading the data back isn't ideal but it may be the best
approach for this particular case.

We will want to prune that description down a lot for any patch going upstream.
Just keep the relevant parts to actually spotting the problem which I think is
mostly a comment on there being far too many interrupts and rcu errors due
to that storm.

Why do you need the lock?  

It would be fine to cache the content of the register in st so
that the pollfunc triggered handler can see what was there.
*sigh* - why do people think read to clear is a sensible hardware design.
It saves an access cycle, but makes software messy.

As you say, that may not be necessary if there are other paths to cheaply
check if there should have been an interrupt.

General approach looks fine to me - but I would like inputs from
others more familiar with this device than I am.
