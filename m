Yes, it could just be a boolean flag. The only thing I have against
that is the awkwardness of having both diff-channels and
differential=false within a channel definition.

No, there is no uncertainty regarding pseudo-differential, it's
basically single-ended.

We cannot use single-channel for voltage channels, two voltage
inputs need to be specified. And again, single-channel will be
used here for the current channels.
