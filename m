Agreed. Would make more sense as a driver parameter than anything else.

For that case, there will still be a 'best' value I think that gets us close
to output rate (from above) as possible.

If it's running with internal rate then we will always have to do a best
aproximation from above.  Often people care about 'at least this rate and not
"too much" more' where too much is very fuzzy as it's more a question of the
system being able to cope with the extra load than any absolute rule.

If we are already doing closest as you say below, then it's probably close enough
that no one has ever moaned about it and we should stick to that.

Agreed, it makes sense to do the same whether it's an external clock or internal
clock.
