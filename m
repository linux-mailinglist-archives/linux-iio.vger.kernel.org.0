Thanks for the explanation Krzysztof. If I understand correctly, having
an vdd-supply in the binding indicates that the device may be powered by
a controllable power source instead of one that is always on.

No problem, I can add the required properties in the next patch version.
I need to make a few changes to the driver anyways.

Just out of curiosity, the sensor supports reassigning of the i2c
address by writing to the 0x21 register from the default address of
0x1a. Is there some way to represent this in the binding.
For future reference, is there some exhaustive list or specification
document for all the allowed properties.

Thanks for the help,
Anshul
