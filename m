Yes, https://uefi.org/PNP_ACPI_Registry has links to PNP and ACPI ID registries.
Note, the main differences between them are:
- PNP uses 3-letter vendor ID, ACPI uses 4-letter
- PNP is in maintenance mode and shouldn't be expanded

So, Since above should formally satisfy the PNP ID, the HDC is not a
TI vendor ID in the PNP ID registry.

The section in the spec that refers to it:
https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.4/06_Device_Configuration/Device_Configuration.html#hid-hardware-id

The PRP0001 is not an abuse per se, but rather it is highly _not_
recommended for a production use.

Thank God!

This is a requirement only for the devices on the market when nobody
prevented the disaster from becoming... Since it's not yet, no need
for it.

How can TI approve that for "HARDCOM ELEKTRONIK & DATATEKNIK"? Is
there evidence that this company has been bought by TI or TI got full
rights on their IPs?

ACPI: TEXAS INSTRUMENTS TXNW
PNP: TEXAS INSTURMENTS TXN
(seems a typo in the company's name, but it should be notified to the
appropriate channels)

So, the ID should start with one of the above, and not HDC as far as I
understood.

PNP: TEXAS MICROSYSTEM TMI
This one probably is not related, but I'm not informed.

I would like you (and your customer) to point to my blog post on the
topic and it explains how the things should be done with the ACPI IDs:
https://andy-shev.dreamwidth.org/151340.html

Hope this will help and be resolved soon.
