Sounds promising. Will try implement something like that.

Seems I've been lucky with it but yes, we would need a dummy transfer to put
controller SDO line in the desired state. I'm thinking it should not be
difficult to make spi-engine SDO line always idle high (or idle in a
pre-configured state). I'll talk with the guys in the HDL team and what can be
done about it.
