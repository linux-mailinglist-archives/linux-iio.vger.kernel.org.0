As I wrote, it is two 8 bit registers at consecutive addresses. And this 
is what u8 arr[2]; also says.

Bulk read is mandatory as HW has a special feature of preventing the 
update of these registers when a read is ongoing. If we do two reads we 
risk of getting one of the registers updated between the accesses - 
resulting incorrect value.

It is two registers. The bulk read might warrant a comment - although I 
believe this is nothing unusual. If it is a hack or not is an opinion. 
To me it looks like a code that explicitly shows what data is and how it 
is being handled. It does what it is supposed to do and shows it in all 
dirty details.

Still, I am open to suggestions but I'd prefer seeing a real improvement 
instead of claiming that the hardware is something it is not (eg, having 
16bit registers or should be read by individual accesses).

The code in this form is no

Of same nature? As I said, there is 2 8bit registers at consecutive 
addresses. They have no other 'nature' as far as I can tell.

Data in these registers in not in standard format - it needs to be 
manipulated to make it an ordinary integer. The code shows this very 
clearly by not reading it in any standard integer.

It's not just le24. We, again, have data placed in registers so that it 
needs some suffling. The data-sheet does decent job explaining it 
though. AFAIR, there was a 'gap' in bits so it needed some more suffling 
to sift the bits so that they're consecutive. I think this indeed is 
something that needs to be looked up from data-sheet to understand why 
this play with bits is done.

Right, this was a bit more precise than "The new macro thingee", thanks 
:) This, however is what I was referring to so what I wrote below still 
applies :)

Yes, we have a few :) Luckily most are more on a styling side of things. 
I do still appreciate you reviewing the patches as I think I do agree 
with most of your suggestions - and having an extra pair of eyes looking 
at the code never hurts :)

Kind of agree. Or by very least it should be else if. But as you said, 
early return is probably better here, thanks.
