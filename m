It's always good to hear there is not many problems found :) This patch 
was not inspired by auditing the existing code - it was inspired by the 
fact that I would have wrongly ordered the available_scan_masks for 
bm1390 myself. I just happened to notice the oddity in active_scan_masks 
while I was trying to figure out if it was the driver, IIO or user-space 
code which messed my buffer when I disabled timestamps.

I think I agree, although I could argue that it depends on the amount of 
added complexity. Still ...

... this suggestion is superior to the check added in this patch.

Yes. And running the check at the registration phase should not be a big 
problem. And, if it appears to be a problem, then we can add a 
registration variant which omits the checks for those rare drivers which 
would _really_ be hurt by the few extra cycles spent on registration.

> That would incorporate ensuring exact matches come earlier by default.

Yes. I like the idea, wish I had invented it myself ;)
