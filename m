Hi,

In principle I support hardening code, though in this case we are talking
about example code only.  We have libiio and similar for anyone who wants
to do more than basic tests.

For this one, in practice it's controlled entirely by the kernel drivers
and they won't get anywhere near integer overflow.  The change is
small however and doesn't hurt readability so I guess no harm applying it.

That would have to be a very large allocation...  I suppose it is possible
someone might try it...

My first inclination is not to apply this on basis that it adds slight complexity
to example code (the aim of which is too illustrate the interface), however on the other
side of things the checks don't add significant complexity...

So I tried to apply it, but it doesn't go on cleanly and patch is telling
me it's malformed. I'm not quite sure why.

patching file tools/iio/iio_generic_buffer.c
patch: **** malformed patch at line 68:                 ret = -ENOMEM;
