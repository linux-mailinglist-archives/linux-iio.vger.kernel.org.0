I don't think it is.

This was what I originally had been thinking. You made me think that we 
should perhaps allow using an external trigger as well - and I tried 
doing that (but obviously didn't test it as I forgot the 
validate_own_trigger in place). I don't really know the potential 
applications for this sensor so I can't imagine if it'd be useful to 
support external triggers. Still, if it is just a matter of dropping the 
validate_own_trigger - then, why limiting the users?

Thanks. I keep mistyping it. I think I've seen checkpatch warnings on 
this kind of mistakes before. Makes me wonder if I forgot to run the

Right. I had a brainfart on this one. Thought that the 
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() would help in case where timestamp 
was disabled by the user. Now I see this thought was very much not 
correct. That's what I get when writing code at the afternoon, and 
especially at Friday afternoon :) My brains are shutting down early :)

Yes...

... and yes. Thank you :)

I think stopping the masurement should indeed be done first. I'm not 
sure why the order is this. I know I tried suffling the order of 
starting the measurement while trying to figure out the temperature 
measurements for first FIFO sample - but I don't think I touched the 
disabling. So, it has probably been like this from the v1. I'll revise 
this, thanks!

No. I can't say the exact meaning of all these flags is 100% clear to me 
- but I think we only have the INDIO_BUFFER_TRIGGERED if we don't have 
the IRQ. Thanks!
