The big missing thing in this ABI is a reference to existing precedence.
You aren't actually defining anything new, it just hasn't yet been generali=
zed
beyond 1 device (unless you include PSK / FSK DDS drivers that are 'still' =
after
13+ years in staging!)

This patch needs to be generalizing that documentation from the ltc2688.

Probably in sysfs-bus-iio-dac

This is presumably the tricky one as that hardware toggle may not be in
control of the host CPU.

This one feels like it could be handled as a software optimisation over
just changing the DAC value directly.

There is precedence for doing it like this (ltc2688)
Note that we should only see these attribute for changes specifically
configured for 'hardware' triggered toggling.

Note that we cannot have duplicate documentation so we need to create
a common docs file covering this and existing ltc2688 ABI that overlaps.
That may need some generalising to cover both parts.

Again, precedence should have been called out.  It's not great ABI
but it corresponds to earlier work on Frequency Shift Keying DDS devices
(and I think Phase Shift Keying as well) in which this is call symbol.
Hence the name.

Was a while back but I think that last time this turned up we concluded
we did need a different interface because the current 'toggle value'
is not in our control.  Hence you are programming one channel that
does different things - think of it as setting the Max and Min values
for a generated waveform - perhaps the toggle pin is connected to a PWM
for example.

It's there in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio
Different form simple enable (which came much later as ABI) because
it means entering a powerdown state in which a particular thing happens
on the output pin.  It is defined alongside powerdown_mode which=20
defines what happens. (often a choice between different impedance / High Z =
etc)
