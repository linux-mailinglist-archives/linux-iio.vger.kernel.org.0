=46rom another thread today I've concluded we do need a single-channel
equivalent of diff-channels, but you are right that here it is a differenti=

channel so <13 10> seems like the best option to me.

Interesting indeed.  So is your thinking that we need to support this
or take that "degraded" comment to imply that we should not bother
(at least until someone actually shouts that they want to do this?)

Yes. I think that makes sense - though as you observe in some cases
the actual device settings end up the same (the ad4116 note above).

If a given channel supports single-ended and pseudo-differential is
that really just a low reference change (I assume from an input to the
the IO ground)? Or is there more going on?

If it's the reference, then can we provide that as the binding control
signal?  We have other drivers that do that (though we could perhaps make
it more generic) e.g. adi,ad7124 with adi,reference-select

I don't like that binding because it always ends up have a local enum
of values, but can't really think of a better solution.

How?  We could do it that way, but we don't have existing ABI for this that
I can think of.

>=20

Provided to user space as _offset on the channel, userspace can either
incorporate it if it wants to compute absolute (relative to some 0V somewhe=
re) value
or ignore it if it only wants the difference from the reference value.

I'm open to discussion other ABI options, but this is the one we most natur=
ally have
available.

I bet you wish sometimes that you had easier parts to write drivers for! :)
These continue to stretch the boundaries which is good, but slow.
