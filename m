Resume can be initiated by generic code too.

Yes, a failure to resume is a big deal.

Well, there can be an error coming from a parent or a supplier, but
the driver will not receive it directly.

I'm not sure I understand the above correctly.

Fair enough.

It should IMV.

Well, it has to physically work in the first place.  If it doesn't,
the rest is a bit moot, because you end up with a non-functional
device that appears to be permanently suspended.

I guess that would boil down to moving the power.runtime_error update
from rpm_callback() to rpm_suspend()?
