Yes, I'll check and add this in the next patch series, I'll wait for 
some more comments on the existing patches for now.

I ran into some error after sending the first two mails (cover letter 
and patch 1), so I sent patches 2 and 3 separately after it, I think you 
may have received them separately.

I think you may have misunderstood the meaning here, I had verified 
compilation works each time after applying each of the three patches in 
this series. It's not that this last patch fixes compilation errors 
caused by the first two, this is a completely separate patch which 
affects existing QCOM ADC code (driver and devicetree) including ADC5 Gen3.


This patch does two things mainly:

Move the ADC binding files from dt-bindings/iio folder to 
dt-bindings/iio/adc folder (this would naturally cause some errors in 
driver and devicetree code due to path update)

Fix all compilation and dtbinding errors generated by the move


I added this change at the end of the series as I was not completely 
sure if it could get picked, just wanted to make it easier to drop if 
that is the final decision.


Thanks,

Jishnu
