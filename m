 My perspective is that support for this is already existent, the chips do not
need any special configuration in that use-case. If we want to be correct in
how the channel will be presented to the user, besides setting to false the IIO
differential flag I do not see what else should be done.

 This precisely why I suggest this approach, because a channel used as
single-ended, pseudo or fully differential will have the same register
configuration on all models. I do not see any other way to know from
the driver this information.

 I'm not sure if I understood what was said here. The reference specified

Expose a voltage channel which is not reading from the device...but that is

_offset is already used when the bipolar coding is enabled on the channel
and is computed along datasheet specifications of how data should be processed,
this is why I disagree with this.

This feels over-engineered, most of the times if a channel is pseudo
differential, the relevant measurement will be the differences between
those two inputs.

If a user needs to know the voltage on the common input, he just needs to
also configure a single ended channel with the common input where the
negative AIN is connected to AVSS.

Not easier, fewer crammed into the same driver :)
