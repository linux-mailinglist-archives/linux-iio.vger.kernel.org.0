What do you mean? The idea behind is the use of the macro depending on
the actual power of 10 in use (taking into account the sign of the
exponent part).

Does it have a physical meaning?

Same question.

Huh?!
I believe the answer to the A and B -- yes, which means there are the
correct and incorrect variants to use.

The (main) idea of the macros is to avoid mistyping 0s in the numbers
and miscalculations. Besides that it also provides the same type for
the constants.

Sounds like we have a chat here between physicists and computer
science folks :-)

Let's try again, does the value in the tmp variable above have a
_physical_ meaning? (I believe so, because all IIO subsystem is about
physical values)

Yes, and using proper macro makes much cleaner the mathematical and
physical point of view to the values.

Again, one needs to think carefully about the meaning.
That's the point. If we do not understand the proper values and their
scales, perhaps that is the issue we should solve first?

Physical meaning of the values, certainly.

Why? (Maybe you are right, maybe not)

Yeah, people hate mathematics at scholls, at university, in life...
