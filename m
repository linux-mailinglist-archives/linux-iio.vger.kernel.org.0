Hi Jonathan,

Sorry for the late reply, I could not get back earlier as I got occupied 
with other work till now. I have addressed your comments inline.

I don't completely understand what you mean here - but first let me 
briefly recap what I was trying to do here.

In patches 1-5 of this series, I intended to update all existing support 
for ADC7 by renaming it to ADC5 Gen2 to match the correct name used 
internally. In addition, since I am adding support for ADC5 Gen3 in 
patches 6 and 7, I thought it would make sense to rename this older 
peripheral, to make it more obvious to everyone that this version lies 
between ADC5 and ADC5 Gen3.

The patches were organized like  this:

Patch 1 - Update documentation to add gen2 compatible and update 
examples(without removing older compatible). Add new binding files 
equivalent to existing ADC7 files, just with macros and file names 
updated to use "adc5_gen2" instead of "adc7"

Patch 2 - Update driver files to replace usage of "adc7" with "adc5 
gen2", adding new compatible for adc5 gen2 without removing exsiting one 
for adc7.

Patch 3 - Update compatible, macros and binding files included in all 
devicetree files, based on the earlier two changes.

Patch 4 - Delete all instances of adc7 compatible from documentation 
files. Delete all older binding files

Patch 5 - Delete the adc7 compatible from the driver


Based on the comments I got, I understand I cannot proceed as such with 
patches 4 and 5, I can amend/drop them. But to get back to your above 
point about my overall approach, how exactly would you like me to 
structure my patch series?

Should I make one big patch for documentation, bindings, driver and 
devicetree changes where I update the naming and deprecate adc7 usage? 
This may be straightforward but also hard to review.


Or a patch series like this:

One patch to update documentation

One patch to update the bindings (headers) (Or one patch per header file?)

One patch to update driver file (adding new compatible and comment to 
deprecate old one)

One patch to update all devicetree files (or separate patches?)

Please let me know what you think.

Will reorder them in the next patchset.

Thanks for your suggestion, I'll do this in the next patchset.
