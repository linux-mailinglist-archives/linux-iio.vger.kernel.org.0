ouch. We all have some cancelled products in our history!
When that happens I usually go eat cake and moan at anyone standing
near by. At least this seems like there will be some direct use of
the work done (sometimes you just have to list the things learnt along
the way).

*sigh* Not even a version number?  Even unreleased / prototype parts should have
different IDs if anything in the interface changed.

Agreed, modify the existing driver. Just needs a clear statement in
patch descriptions that the original part is not expected to be in the wild.

Separate patches preferred for each feature / type of change. Mostly
they'll hopefully be trivial to review.

Yes. The binding patch in particular will need a really clear statement
that we believe there are none in products in the wild.

True enough. It's always 'interesting' to not know if / when a product
you've upstreamed code for will launch.
