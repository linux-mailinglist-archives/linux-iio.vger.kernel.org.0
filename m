Hi Jonathan,
In our hardware board, we have "ti,hdc1080" as main source, and "silabs,si7020"
for 2nd source. This two chip are locate at same bus and same slave address,
and we want to use multiple compatibles to support both chips with single device
node in device tree.
 
Ex:
compatible = "ti,hdc1099", "silabs,si7020";
 
In order to support this, I need to add ID checking mechanism into the current
hdc100x driver, so the si7020 chip will fail to probe with hdc100x driver
(because the ID checking is not failed), then success probe with si7020.
 
Base on you explanation, it looks multiple compatibles is not suitable in this
case? Would you mind advise us what would be the better approach for our case?

Thanks,
Potin
