Yeah DS3501 is similar to DS3502 with an additional temperature sensor.

Thanks for your input. I will try to add the DS3502 with the existing
driver DS1803
then I will try to add DS3501 to the same driver.
There are drivers like iio/temperature/maxim_thermocouple.c and
iio/adc/max1027.c
where multiple devices with some differences are handled with a single
driver file.
I will consider them as references to add the ds3502 into existing ds1803.c.
