I think the confusion comes from the fact that in the
current implementation, Trigger IRQ and EOC IRQ handlers are the same.
This comes from a possible misunderstanding in the previous review,
where I understood that you and Nuno wanted to keep using
iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() hand have a single handler in the
driver (which I think is far from optimal). I can try to split that
handler again to have two distinct paths.

Also, to answer Nuno about the question: is this actually working: IIRC
I mentioned it in the cover letter but my hardware does not have the
EOC line wired so I am unable to actually test that I am not breaking
this. My main goal is to be able to use external triggers (such as a
timer) and I am a bit struggling with the constraints of my hardware +
the design of this chip.

I will provide a third implementation in v3 and if this still does not
fit your mental model please guide me with maybe an untested code
snippet just to show me how you think this should be implemented.

Thank you both for the numerous reviews and precious feedback anyway!
