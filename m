What you wrote sums it up very well. READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE are required 
for correctness when no lock is used. The compiler is allowed to do all 
sorts of optimizations that could break multi-threading, when 
READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE is not used. E.g.

if (x)
   foo->bar = 10;
else
   foo->bar = 20;

Could be implemented as

foo->bar = 20;
if (x)
   foo->bar = 10;

In the absence of multi-threading the result will be the same. But if 
another thread reads foo->bar just at the right time it will read the 
incorrect 20.

For simple things like `foo->bar = x;` it is unlikely that the compiler 
will do anything other than the single store. But it could and the code 
is not correct without the WRITE_ONCE.

Using a mutex is OK, since non of this is performance critical.
