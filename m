Yes, that's also the case for ad4000 series. The rising edge of CNV triggers
the conversion which causes a latency/delay of one read if CNV is connected
to a chip select.
I thought it was okay to just accept the latency since it's intrinsic to the
ADC start conversion on CNV rising edge and latency would be less noticeable
when doing continuous sampling.
Although, this indeed causes the timestamps to be disarranged, which is making me
rethink the implementation.
Yet, if we choose to have extra pulse of CNV for the sake of getting correct
timesamps, that might also impact performance for high sample rates (unless
split sample handling into different cases for single-shot and buffered readings).
I'll give it try and do it like ad7944.

This sounds reasonable to me. I also think the comments on DT patch are good.
Will comment there too.

Okay, will make it do the extra pulse to CNV for "3-wire" mode.

Not sure I understand the idea here. Should the driver use
devm_regulator_get_optional() instead of devm_regulator_get() because
the optional call would fail immediately if no vref-supply while the regular
call would only fail at regulator_get_voltage()? Why? This looks very counter
intuitive to me.

ADC CNV is connected to controller CS and ADC SDI to controller SDO.
Think it's something to do with buffer alignment.
Will try the changes suggested in reply to driver patch.
