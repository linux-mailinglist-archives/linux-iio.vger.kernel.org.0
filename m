No problem. Autumn is approaching and darkness is falling in Finland...

Yes. I am talking about 2). And my stance is that device drivers belong 
to category 2). If one works with a device driver for some HW, then 
he/she needs to be willing to understand the hardware.

I can't avoid having a feeling that this is a very unlikely scenario. I 
am afraid that by requesting this type of improvements at patch series 
which is at v8 and has been running for half an year (and which was of a 
good quality to start with, especially knowing this was the author's 
first driver) is going to be more repulsive to the newcomers than the 
potential obfuscation.

I don't try claiming that no-one could ever hit this trap (even if I 
don't see it likely). I still believe that if one does so, he/she will 
also get such a bug fixed without being totally discouraged - it's 
business as usual.

I hope this does not come out as rude. I do appreciate your reviews, 
it's comforting to know someone looks my code with sharp eyes and points 
out things like the dead code in BM1390 driver! I just like the words 
Jonathan once spilled out:

"Don't let the perfect be enemy of good" (or something along those lines).

Well, who knows how things will be working out for the new generations? 
Maybe they won't need the kernel in the future? Yes, I am stubbornly 
hanging in the past practices and values. Direction things seem to head 
do not always appeal to me - but perhaps it's just me? Who can say my 
values and practices are the right ones for new generations :) My oldest 
son just moved to his own home and I need to accept that young do build 
their own lives on different values I had. And who knows, maybe the 
approach of just doing things without knowing what exactly happens under 
the hood makes this world very good for them?

But yes - I don't think it suits the kernel project at all :) This is a 
project of dinosaurs like us XD

(DISCLAIMER: I don't know quite all young people in the world. Frankly 
to tell, not even 90% XD So, I am not trying to say "all young people 
are like this or that". I just have a feeling that certain way of 
thinking is more common amongst certain generations - but maybe it's 
just my misjudgement. Please, don't be offended).
