CI is in many ways the biggest one + formality of definition vs the older
text files where to put it likely things were often rather vague.
yaml has it's 'interesting corners' and a rather steep learning curve but
I'm not aware of anything better and we are stuck with it now anyway!

It's very much a work in progress so best practice is still evolving.
The stm32-adc ones are now quite old and reflect a very complex bit of hardware.
adc/ti-tsc2076.yaml is fairly similar and up to date.

Problem with bindings vs other code is we can't update everything to the
current view on how to do things because of backwards compatibility. Over time
we'll eventually get there as the parts people use in designs are replaced but
that's a lot longer game than for almost anything else.

Sad truth with bindings is they almost always go through a couple of revisions
as a result. Ideally I'd write some docs on what we consider best practice
for IIO drivers as that could at least be kept up to date, but lots of other
things on the todo list :( 

+ today patches are coming in slightly quicker than I review them. *sigh* :)
