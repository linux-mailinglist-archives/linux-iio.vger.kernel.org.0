Hi William,

I am going to send a new version (PATCH v5) without buffers as described 
above
(I added macros for cap1/2/3/4 similar functions). I tried taking into 
account the
comments made by Jonathan and you.

Regarding buffers, I don't know how driver upstream process is done when 
'significant'
subsystem modifications are being considered. Is it a problem for you if 
we continue
driver upstream process until it's merged, and then modify counter 
subsystem (and
ECAP driver with it) to add some buffer functionalities ? Or do you 
prefer adding such
functionalities to counter subsystem while upstreaming ECAP driver, 
without any
intermediate ECAP driver version ?
