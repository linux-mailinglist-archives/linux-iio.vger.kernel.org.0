Basically fine - a few trivial comments inline that I'm not that fussed
about whether you take notice of or not. As such

I'd have liked to have seen a change log here. Quite a few comments on this
one and not all had 'obvious' resolutions.

Change log for the patch would have made it easier to see you decided
to make this change after the discussion in v2.

Slight preference for a direct return here even though it means
replicating the ERR_PTR() statement.  Makes for one less error
path where a reviewer has to go see what is being done.

Nitpick: Unusual spacing (to my eye anyway). I wouldn't expect to see a blank line after a label
as the label indentation makes a visual separation anyway.
