Hello,

As part of a previous discussion with Jonathan (I know, it was three
months ago, sorry for the delay :-$), it appeared necessary to do a
little bit of cleanup in the IIO core and at least provide a little bit
more documentation for developers diving into the IIO subsystem for the
first time. My first move was to write a blog post trying to explain
(from my point of view but with the review of Jonathan) what is
necessary to understand when writing and IIO kernel driver:
https://bootlin.com/blog/the-backbone-of-a-linux-industrial-i-o-driver/

Here is now the second halve of this work, with few things that I tried
to address.

* The currentmode indio_dev entry was misused by several device drivers,
  I tried to understand which ones were wrong (there are two still
  accessing this variable left, I decided not to touch them because I
  think it is legitimate) and I tried to find an alternative.

* Then, I tried to make new accesses to this variable harder in order to
  avoid future mistakes, by creating a couple of helpers and moving it
  to the opaque structure.

* I continued with the IIO modes which are completely
  undocumented. Following a few exchanges with Jonathan, I tried to take
  most of this discussion and put it into a kernel doc header.

* When doing the above task, I realized that there was a particular case
  handled for kfifo buffers which I tried to simplify, but if this is a
  mistake, I'll just drop the patch.

Hope this will help!

Cheers,
MiquÃ¨l
