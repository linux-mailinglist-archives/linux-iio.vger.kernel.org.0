I think that could work. If IRQs are always disabled before events_list
is modified, then there is never a risk of interacting with an invalid
events_list and thus counter_push_events() won't need spinlocks. When
IRQs are disabled we miss any possible events, but we are missing those
already anyway when the events_list is modified.
