Ah ok.  This is implying that we are switching to a controllable
mode to pull that pin high (or I guess one where it is always
high).  I'm not sure if that's more common than an SPI controller
where you can set the 'don't' care state to high or low.
I assume we can't get away with just setting the output buffer
to all 1s because it won't hold that state between transfers?

Feels like that could be rolled into the SPI subsystem with
any necessary transitions handled there (maybe)

Just to check, this isn't just a case of a missing pull up
resistor to drag that line correctly when it isn't actively
driven (combined with all 1s in the write buffer) etc?
