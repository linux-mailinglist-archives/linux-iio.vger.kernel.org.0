After looking into how to change the code to introduce the new guard(mutex)
I encountered the following situation.

In general, with the new guard(mutex) functinality you can remove most of the
goto statements and return immediately without doing the cleanup yourself. 
In the case of this driver, in the read_raw() call, apart from the mutex, 
the power management functions are also used. This means that in each case, 
before returning, the pm functions will need to be called, which I don't
know if it will actually make the code cleaner. Have a look below with
an example.

----- Current Implementation -----

static int bmp280_read_raw( ... )
{
	...

	pm_runtime_get_sync_data(data->dev);
	mutex_lock(&data->lock);

	switch (mask) {
	case 1:
		switch (channel) {
		case TEMP:
			ret = read_temp();
			break;
		case PRESS:
			ret = read_press();
			break;
		...
	case 2:
		switch (channel) {
		...

	case 3:
		...
	default:
		ret = -EINVAL;
		break;
	}

	mutex_unlock(&data->lock);
	pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(data->dev);
	pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(data->dev);

	return ret;
}

----- End of Current Implementation -----

With the use of the guard(mutex)(&data->lock) you could immediately
return without all the break statements. But we still need to call
the pm functions. So the code, as far as I can understand will look
like this:

----- Guard Mutex Implementation -----

static int bmp280_read_raw( ... )
{
	...

	pm_runtime_get_sync_data(data->dev);
	guard(mutex)(&data->lock);

	switch (mask) {
	case 1:
		switch (channel {
		case TEMP:
			ret = read_temp();
			pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(data->dev);
			pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(data->dev);
			return ret;
		case PRESS:
			ret = read_press();
			pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(data->dev);
			pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(data->dev);
			return ret;
		...
	case 2:
		switch (channel) {
		...
	case 3:
		...
	default:
		return -EINVAL;
	}

	return 0;
}

----- End of Guard Mutex Implementation -----

Have I completely misunderstood something? If what I explain
above is correct, you think that this is a better implementation
and I should move forward becasue we want to use the guard(mutex)
functionality? 

Maybe it is necessary to create some new type of guard to call
also the pm functions before exiting?
