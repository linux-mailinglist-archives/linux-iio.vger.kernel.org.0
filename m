Series applied to the togreg branch of iio.git and pushed out as testing
to let 0-day take a look before I go breaking linux-next (again :)

You get the same general feedback for future series as I just gave Antoniu:

1) Particularly when doing multiple revisions close together, please give
   a longer change log covering at least the last few versions as not
   everyone will have looked at v7 and it saves reviewers time otherwise
   spent checking back through earlier versions.
2) Cover letters are good for multipatch series because they both provide
   somewhere for general discussion that overlaps multiple patches and
   as somewhere for series wide tags to be given and that sometimes
   makes my life easier (complex cases where some tags are for individual
   patches and some are series wide which I have to go in an add by hand
   as no automated tool e.g. b4, could work it out!) 

Sometimes I like to complain about this trivial stuff that makes me
ever so slightly grumpy :)
