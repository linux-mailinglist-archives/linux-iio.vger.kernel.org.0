One thing to watch out for in the datasheet is the difference between
the fault output pins and the fault bits read over the bus. The LOS
output pin does indicate one or more of multiple faults, but we are
not currently using that. We are only looking at the fault bits which
are more granular.

I suppose it _could_ be possible on the high side if the AVDD voltage
supply was selected to be less than the 4.4V max of the threshold
voltage registers.

I found the clipping error useful while developing this driver since
it help identify that we had a gain setting wrong on the excitation
output (on the circuit board) which in turn caused the inputs to be
overdriven. But, yes when this happened, it also always triggered at
least one or more of the LOS and DOS faults as well.
