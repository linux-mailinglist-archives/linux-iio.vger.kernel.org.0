Hi Cosmin,

Happy New year for a few day's time.

Interesting.  We should figure out some way to make that clear to userspace
given right now it has no way of knowing that and might set inappropriate limits
without that information.

It's kind of similar to some of the adaptive thresholds, just that it uses
the value at a particular moment.

Worth noting that for the adxl362 at least the maths is
ABS(Acceleration - reference) > Threshold which is a magnitude not a threshold
unless you want to represent it as a pair of thresholds (above and below) which
gets fiddly as I assume there is only one control

Hmm. I'm not sure what the right thing to do here is. Maybe we need a docs update
to explicitly call out that this might happen for the event enables?  Calling
it out for all devices is fine because all we are doing is saying userspace would
ideally cope with this situation and make the decision to disable the buffered
mode if it wants to enable events then reenable it afterwards if that is what
is desired.
