I was not so worried about the driver being postponed. I was prepared to 
suggest to merging a subset of the patches if need be - while I can 
continue work with the rest of the series ;)

What comes to people being interested in the core-changes Vs. people 
being interested in the driver changes - I'd expect the core changes to 
concern much wider audience than the driver changes. But yes, knowing 
the amount of mails people go through, limiting the recipient to most 
relevant ones never hurts. Besides, I think there is no 
conflicts/dependencies as driver changes don't change core/tools, and 
core/tool changes don't touch the driver so splitting this to two series 
should be trivial. Will do that for next version.

Yours,
