Hmm. I took a look via lore before sending this moan and didn't think
this actually had that large a list of CCs but maybe my counting wasn't
great (lots of overlaps between different patches).

The series is also not a tree wide change.
It's a set of changes related only by the fact they are using
a call to the same set of functions and the series is based
on next (which is usually a bad idea as a tree to base anything on).
Arguably there are two different sets of functions at that (the bitmap
ones and the cpumask ones)

This is a good set of changes, but taking it slowly and sending these
out as a number of different series after rc1 would have made
much more sense to me.  That way visibility would have been good
and they could have been applied through the various individual trees.

If there is a reason to want to take this via a common tree then
that information needs to be conveyed to all the subsystem maintainers.
