+devm_counter_register function may be used if device memory-managed
+registration is desired.
+
+The struct counter_comp structure is used to define counter extensions
+for Signals, Synapses, and Counts.
+
+The "type" member specifies the type of high-level data (e.g. BOOL,
+COUNT_DIRECTION, etc.) handled by this extension. The "``*_read``" and
+"``*_write``" members can then be set by the counter device driver with
+callbacks to handle that data using native C data types (i.e. u8, u64,
+etc.).
+
+Convenience macros such as ``COUNTER_COMP_COUNT_U64`` are provided for
+use by driver authors. In particular, driver authors are expected to use
+the provided macros for standard Counter subsystem attributes in order
+to maintain a consistent interface for userspace. For example, a counter
+device driver may define several standard attributes like so::
+
+        struct counter_comp count_ext[] = {
+                COUNTER_COMP_DIRECTION(count_direction_read),
+                COUNTER_COMP_ENABLE(count_enable_read, count_enable_write),
+                COUNTER_COMP_CEILING(count_ceiling_read, count_ceiling_write),
+        };
+
+This makes it simple to see, add, and modify the attributes that are
+supported by this driver ("direction", "enable", and "ceiling") and to
+maintain this code without getting lost in a web of struct braces.
+
+Callbacks must match the function type expected for the respective
+component or extension. These function types are defined in the struct
+counter_comp structure as the "``*_read``" and "``*_write``" union
+members.
+
+The corresponding callback prototypes for the extensions mentioned in
+the previous example above would be::
+
+        int count_direction_read(struct counter_device *counter,
+                                 struct counter_count *count,
+                                 enum counter_count_direction *direction);
+        int count_enable_read(struct counter_device *counter,
+                              struct counter_count *count, u8 *enable);
+        int count_enable_write(struct counter_device *counter,
+                               struct counter_count *count, u8 enable);
+        int count_ceiling_read(struct counter_device *counter,
+                               struct counter_count *count, u64 *ceiling);

-Architecture
-============
-
-When the Generic Counter interface counter module is loaded, the
-counter_init function is called which registers a bus_type named
-"counter" to the system. Subsequently, when the module is unloaded, the
-counter_exit function is called which unregisters the bus_type named
-"counter" from the system.
-
-Counter devices are registered to the system via the counter_register
-function, and later removed via the counter_unregister function. The
-counter_register function establishes a unique ID for the Counter
-device and creates a respective sysfs directory, where X is the
-mentioned unique ID:
-
-    /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX
-
-Sysfs attributes are created within the counterX directory to expose
-functionality, configurations, and data relating to the Counts, Signals,
-and Synapses of the Counter device, as well as options and information
-for the Counter device itself.
-
-Each Signal has a directory created to house its relevant sysfs
-attributes, where Y is the unique ID of the respective Signal:
-
-    /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY
-
-Similarly, each Count has a directory created to house its relevant
-sysfs attributes, where Y is the unique ID of the respective Count:
-
-    /sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY
-
-For a more detailed breakdown of the available Generic Counter interface
-sysfs attributes, please refer to the
-Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-counter file.
-
-The Signals and Counts associated with the Counter device are registered
-to the system as well by the counter_register function. The
-signal_read/signal_write driver callbacks are associated with their
-respective Signal attributes, while the count_read/count_write and
-function_get/function_set driver callbacks are associated with their
-respective Count attributes; similarly, the same is true for the
-action_get/action_set driver callbacks and their respective Synapse
-attributes. If a driver callback is left undefined, then the respective
-read/write permission is left disabled for the relevant attributes.
-
-Similarly, extension sysfs attributes are created for the defined
-counter_device_ext, counter_count_ext, and counter_signal_ext
-structures that are passed in.
+Subsystem Architecture
+======================
+
+Counter drivers pass and take data natively (i.e. ``u8``, ``u64``, etc.)
+and the shared counter module handles the translation between the sysfs
+interface. This guarantees a standard userspace interface for all
+counter drivers, and enables a Generic Counter chrdev interface via a
+generalized device driver ABI.
+
+A high-level view of how a count value is passed down from a counter
+driver is exemplified by the following. The driver callbacks are first
+registered to the Counter core component for use by the Counter
+userspace interface components::
