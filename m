Yup, needs combination of Co-developed-by and a Sign off for this case as in
effect both of you wrote the code.

That's fine.

See https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst
for lots of detail.  The fixes tag has a particular format and goes in the main
tag block. Lots of examples in tree so can just take a look at the git history for
how to apply these rules in practice.

No. Tags should be explicitly given.  I tend not to give RB for stuff I'll pick up
because they will have my SoB anyway as the person who applies the patches
and that includes reviewing.

In this case, Andreas asked for a tag to be included whereas I have not.
