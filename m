Good because I'm fairly sure you need to reduce the masklength int hat
bitmap_empty as well.  It is getting a bit complex.

It does indeed.

IIRC this is there to allow for sparse scan_index values.  Those are
very rare, but I think there are a few drivers doing that because
it allowed for slightly simpler code a long time back.  May not even
matter today.  Key is that mask_length is big enough to allow the
bits at all present scan_index values to be set.

So it should always match with the drivers where this is used to make
sure available_scan_masks has the right number of longs per entry,
but the drivers may need to be a little clever if they are both
doing large numbers of channels and sparse scan_index values.
AFAIK there are none doing that. Going further I don't recall any
drivers that use the available_scan_masks stuff going beyond 32
channels (so needing more than one unsigned long per element).

Ah. yes, that is indeed a bug.  I'm not sure your fix is particularly
fragile though.  This comes back to us having no drivers that actually use
big bitmaps yet.

Key is that we need the available_scan_masks null terminator to be the
same length as any other entry - so if multiple unsigned longs needed
then multiple 0's should be there.  We should definitely document that
and ideally add a test case.   We can bulk out the dummy driver
to trigger these and provide an example of how available_scan_masks
should be set.

Too complex.

That would kick the problem into the long grass.

Agreed it's problematic as that null terminator isn't clearly forced to
be big enough.  Hmm. Can we cheat for any drivers that actually need large
masks (when they come along) and use an appropriate 2D array.

unsigned long available_masks[][2] = {
	{mask0_ll, mask0_hl},
	{mask0_ll, mask0_hl},
	{}
};

	iio_dev->available_scan_masks = (unsigned long *)available_masks;

If we put such an example into the dummy / example driver then that might
act to avoid us getting bugs in future + test the fix you have above and
related.
