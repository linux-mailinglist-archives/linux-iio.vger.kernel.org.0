No sure I understood the problem here. If you keep the driver as is and
in userspace just read out the counter value twice and measure the time
between the reads[1], you can calculate the average frequency of the
event in userspace.

Isn't that good enough?

Best regards
Uwe

[1] maybe support this timing by providing a timestamp with the read
    value to reduce timing jitter.
