Without the available mask that is a little fiddly you'll have
deal with  channel 0 only enabled, channel 1 only enabled and
both channels 0 and channel 1 enabled.
Not too bad though as only 2 channels.

Ideally it wouldn't check them - the hardwork has been done to read both
channels anyway and the IIO core handles userspace or in kernel consumers
that want a subset of what is enabled, but that needs the available_scan_ma=
sks
to be set so that the IIO core knows all channels always enabled.

yeah. Hindsight!

We could add it in an incremental fashion though
iio_push_to_bufs(struct iio_dev *indio_dev, void *buf, size_t buf_len)
with a length parameter.  The oddity that is
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() would benefit here as that needs
a bigger buffer than immediately apparent in the driver and we've
had a few bugs around that over the years.

It would probably be a one way check.
I might have a play and see how useful this would be.
