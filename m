Hi Massimo,

The standard approach to avoiding rapid power up and power down cycles
is to use runtime_pm with autosuspend and a period set at a period
of perhaps 1 second.  Would that work for you?  You'll pay the costs
of power up only on the first read after a period of not reading.

Exposing the control to userspace for this sort of thing is normally
a bad idea because userspace generally has no idea if it should use it
as there is no clean way of telling userspace the costs of not using
it (as those will be device specific).

If you have a usecase that requires regular reading you should also
think about whether using the buffered interface is more appropriate.
IIRC that will keep these devices powered up continuously whilst
the buffer is enabled and will provide a lower overhead way of
reading data than sysfs reads.

Jonathan
