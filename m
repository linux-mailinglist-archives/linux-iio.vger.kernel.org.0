Fulfilling my own request here...

Since AD9467 is being use as the example first user of the IIO offload fram=
ework
I did a deep dive into how it is actually being used. It looks like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-
Hardware
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-

AD9467
------

High-speed ADC that uses SPI for configuration and LVDS for data capture.

https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD9467.=
pdf

Pins:

    Supplies:
    - AVDD1 (1.8V analog supply)
    - AVDD2 (3.3V analog supply)
    - AVDD3 (1.8V analog supply)
    - SPIVDD (1.8V or 3.3V SPI supply)
    - DRVDD (1.8V digital output driver supply)
    - XVREF (optional reference voltage)

    SPI:
    - CSB
    - SDIO
    - SCLK

    Analog input:
    - VIN+/VIN-

    Clock input:
    - CLK+/CLK-

    Digital output:
    - Dn-/Dn+ (parallel digital output)
    - DCO+/DCO- (data clock output)
    - OR+/OR- (out of range output)


ADI AXI ADC
-----------

FPGA IP core for interfacing an ADC device with a high speed serial (JESD20=
4B)
or source synchronous parallel interface (LVDS/CMOS).

https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/axi_adc_ip

Interfaces:

    LVDS:
    - rx_clk_in_[p|n]   clock input
    - rx_data_in_[p|n]  parallel data input
    - rx_frame_in_[p|n] frame input signal (optional/device specific)
    - rx_or_in_[p|n]    over range input (optional/device specific)

    Write FIFO:
    - see link for details, this consists of multiple signals that connect =
to a
      "sink module"

    MMIO:
    - memory mapped registers (detailed in link)


"sink module"
-------------

FPGA IP core for piping a data stream to DMA.

https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/util_var_fifo

Interfaces:

    Data Input:
    - data_in           Data to be stored
    - data_in_valid     Valid for the input data

    Data Output:
    - data_out          Data forwarded to the DMA
    - data_out_valid    Valid for the output data

    There are additional interfaces but they probably don't concern devicet=
ree
    since software doesn't interact with them (AFAIK).

Discussion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-

After reviewing the existing device tree bindings, it appears the current
adi,ad9467.yaml is incomplete. It lacks the supplies and even though the
example shows that it is a child of a spi node, it is missing a reference t=
o
/schemas/spi/spi-peripheral-props.yaml# and spi properties like spi-3wire
and spi-max-frequency. It also misses a description of what is connected to
the digital output, but that I think that is the main thing we are trying t=
o
solve here - if it belongs there or somewhere else.

Having read more about the AXI ADC IP block, it seems to me like it should =
just
be considered an LVDS bus controller with generic bindings similar to how w=
e
have SPI and I2C buses.

Following that line of thought, if the compatible =3D "adi,axi-adc-10.0.a" =
node
is a bus node, then logically, the ADC device node should be a child node o=
f
that LVDS bus node. But since the ADC is also a SPI device it also needs to
be a child node of the SPI bus node. But is can't be a child of two differe=
nt
nodes, so where does it go?

This is where the IIO backend framework can come in. We can create a "compo=
site"
device as seen in the example dts above. This is just a platform device (in
Linux-speak) and it composes the two "io-backend" devices from the the two
busses to create a logical iio/adc device.

To solve the mystery of "where does the dmas property belong?", I have take=
n
a page out of the work I am preparing the AXI SPI Engine offload support [1=
].
(This hasn't been submitted to a mailing list yet because I'm still working
on the driver, but the bindings are finished and I ran the idea by Rob on I=
RC
a while back who suggested doing it this way, so maybe it works here too?)

Since the "sink module" is really a separate IP block from the AXI ADC, it =
gets
its own node and compatible string. Since these "sink modules" are connecte=
d to
the AXI ADC, they get listed as child nodes, but we group them together und=
er a
single sink-modules node to separate them from the LVDS peripherals nodes. =
Then
they get associated with a peripheral with the adi,sink-modules property (a=
lso
see comment on that property in the example above).

My "composite" device example evolved quite a bit as I was writing this but=
 I'm
pretty happy with where it ended up. I think adding child nodes to the axi-=
adc
node answers Nuno's concerns about how to keep a generic axi-adc binding wh=
ile
accounting for the fact that it changes slightly depending on what it is
attached to. And having a separate platform device solves my questions abou=
t
the ambiguity of which should be the front end, the spi node or the axi-adc
node. It turns out, perhaps the answer is neither.
