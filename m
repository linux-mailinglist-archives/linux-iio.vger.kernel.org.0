I think that in this case the max_size_in_scan would be 1, and min(1, 8) 
would be 1 as well, resulting a tightly packed data. I am just wondering 
if we should use 8 as maximum alignment - eg, if our scan has 16 bytes 
data + 1 byte data, we would add 7 bytes of padding, not 15 bytes of 
padding. I am not sure what is the right thing to do.

So, whether to unconditionally use largest scan element sized alignment 
- or largest scan element up to 8 bytes - is a question we haven't hit 
yet :)

Actually, more I stare at the alignment code here, less sure I am it is 
correct - but maybe I don't understand how the data should be aligned.

I think it works if allowed data sizes are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, I 
suspect it breaks for other sizes.

For non power of2 sizes, the alignment code will result strange 
alignments. For example, scan consisting of two 6-byte elements would be 
packed - meaning the second element would probably break the alignment 
rules by starting from address '6'. I think that on most architectures 
the proper access would require 2 padding bytes to be added at the end 
of the first sample. Current code wouldn't do that.

If we allow only power of 2 sizes - I would expect a scan consisting of 
a 8 byte element followed by a 16 byte element to be tightly packed. I'd 
assume that for the 16 byte data, it'd be enough to ensure 8 byte 
alignment. Current code would however add 8 bytes of padding at the end 
of the first 8 byte element to make the 16 byte scan element to be 
aligned at 16 byte address. To my uneducated mind this is not needed - 
but maybe I just don't know what I am writing about :)

In any case, the patch here should fix things when allowed scan element 
sizes are 1, 2, 4 and 8 and we have to add padding after last scan 
element. It won't work for other sizes, but as I wrote, I suspect the 
whole alignment code here may be broken for other sizes so things 
shouldn't at least get worse with this patch... I think this should be 
revised if we see samples of other sizes - and in any case, this might 
at least warrant a comment here :) (I reserve a right to be wrong. 
Haven't been sleeping too well lately and my head is humming...)
