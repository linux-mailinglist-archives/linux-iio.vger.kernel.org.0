Why?  This is a way to control precision of an ADC channel read out.
That's policy rather than dependent on the hardware.
To be in DT we (mostly) need it to be related to the hardware configuration
(i.e. what it is wired to etc).

Same as for above.  This is policy. If you want to control it that belongs
in a udev script or similar, not the DT bindings.
We tend to resist defining such policy in DT because it isn't a characteristic
of the hardware and depending on the usecase userspace may have good reason
to tweak the settings (or consumer drivers if you have those as sometimes
these numbers are about getting a particular precision needed for what
we are measuring to be useful for another driver).

There is some legacy for this though as you point out. So that may be a
strong enough argument for why we should make an exception this time.
If so make that clear in the patch description.

If you change DT binding for older devices, you will need to maintain
backwards compatibility.  It's fine to deprecate them in the binding
docs etc, but not the driver (as there may be old DT on devices that
can't be easily updated).
