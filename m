I don't see how io_uring would help us. It's an async I/O framework,=20
does it allow us to access a kernel buffer without copying the data?=20
Does it allow us to zero-copy the data to a network interface?

We want both. Using dma-bufs for the driver/userspace interface is a=20
convenience as we then have a unique API instead of two distinct ones.

Why should CPU access from userspace be the exception? It works fine=20
for IIO dma-bufs. You keep warning about this being a terrible design,=20
but I simply don't see it.

Cheers,
