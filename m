Possibly. What's the semantics of the `preset` component BTW? If we can 
re-use that here as well, that could work too.

It is exactly the latter. And you can configure which edge should sample 
which register; you can also set them to the same edge in which case 
they would (presumably) hold the same value, but as you said, it 
wouldn't be practical.

Yeah true, I could shove the RC compare event to event channel 0. It 
just made more sense to have event channels 0, 1, 2 correspond to RA, RB 
and RC. And it's not like we're short on channels, it's a u8, and we 
have 5 events; if we wanted to, we could give each a channel and still 
have plenty left over. I also thought about separating RA capture from 
channel 0, but I figured it would be fine, as you said, the event type 
would differentiate among them.

The reason I did not put the RC compare event to channel 0 as well is 
that I only have the SAMA5D2, and I don't know whether other parts are 
capable of generating other events related to RC, potentially clashing 
with other channel 0 use, if we later decide to support them. One 
channel per event-sourcing register seems like a safe bet; having CV and 
RA on the same channel still seems to be an acceptable compromise (but 
again, I don't know about the other parts' capabilities, so it _might_ 
still lead to clashes).

The `mchp_tc_count_function_write()` function already disables PWM mode 
by clearing the `ATMEL_TC_WAVE` bit from the Channel Mode Register (CMR).
