Have more confidence!  RFCs need to have clearly stated questions.
If you don't have any then you are putting forwards driver for review
in ordering to get it merged upstream - so PATCH is appropriate.
As you'll see many IIO drivers go through a 'few' revisions once they
are posted (hopefully not too many!)

Krzysztof is great at reviewing whatever shows up, but in many
cases reviewers won't look at an RFC (unless a big discussion starts) becau=
se
they aren't interested in open questions, just code that the author conside=
rs
ready.
