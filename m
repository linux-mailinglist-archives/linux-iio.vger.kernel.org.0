Means you want to handle control to the standalone driver from bmc150.
Sorry, I didn't find any examples.

Important thing to handle is the bmi323 private structure and call required
exported functions from another driver.

Jonathan: Can you suggest any example wrapper drivers which handle that way=
?

 Is it correct leaving files called bmc150-accel-* even if it is managing a=
nother IC and and not just the accelerometer part anymore?
