Currently the object of the properties is the same as struct __Txx_fract.
In the future it may indeed be expanded. In such case I see that the layering
might look like

struct ..._props {
	struct __Txx_fract fract;
	...
};

Of course it depends on the properties themselves, but at least that's
how I believe the OOP paradigm works. Am I mistaken?

Thanks for valuable comments!

I postponed the change in any case, let Liam to finish his part first,
which we agreed is more important.
