Indeed, it's common to have boot firmware prelinux modify the DT.

That firmware can do probing if necessary to find out which device is present
and by the time Linux loads the DT should be correct for the particular
hardware.  Often this is done from a high level 'board ID' but nothing
stops you doing it this case.

I've cc'd the device tree binding maintainers and list, who may be able
to give you some useful pointers to examples of people doing this
in their boot loaders etc.

Thanks,
