2 options, indeed :
1) By grouping them under the same channel, the only thing I'm not a 
great fan of is that
I will need to use separate functions to read capture registers 
(cap1_read/cap2_read/
cap3_read/cap4_read), and also to set/get polarity.
2) By using separate channels, code will look more simple but it is 
likely to be a little bit
confusing for the user.
I will probably use option 2.

Thank you for all these explanations. After a few hours working with 
counter subsystem
I began to understand how it works, but now it's fully clear.
