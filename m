It's not equivalent, but in an ideal world they would have been. Most
of the time, one should be using for_each_available_child_of_node() as
that treats disabled nodes as if they were non-existent.
Unfortunately, there are some cases where walking the disabled nodes
is desirable/needed. On !Arm, disabled CPU nodes are ones that are
offline for example.

Ideally, we would have had for_each_child_of_node() and
for_each_yes_I_really_want_disabled_child_of_node() instead.

That may have been based on my feedback so that fwnode has the 'right'
interface...
