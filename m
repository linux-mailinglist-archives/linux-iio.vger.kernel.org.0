Sure - as far as I'm concerned - it looks like it should be possible to do something
generic, but without a prototype it's hard to be sure how fiddly that will be.

+CC Mark Brown who might be able to give a more informed answer to whether such a
thing would work / be easy to implement.

I've no idea how common this trick is.  If it's a one off, may not be worth the bother
of a more generic mux like binding whether that is the more elegant solution or
not.
