Hi Jonathan,

Sorry for taking so long to give you an update on things.
We've been quite busy with the organizational aspects of the
event. Anyways, we're all set for KDD. We're keeping touch
with all the great fellas at Analog, who've helped us a
great bunch. They've helped us set a battle plan for
tomorrow and we're ready to put things in motion!

Adding a tiny little comment inline below replying to one of
your comments. :)

Many thanks!
Renato and everyone at KDD

You're too kind, Jonathan. We don't want to give you any
trouble. Especially because of the significant difference
in timezones. Besides, I'm assuming we're only going to be
sending in patches to IIO late in the day, and only after
passing an internal review, so please don't waste your
weekend on us. :)
