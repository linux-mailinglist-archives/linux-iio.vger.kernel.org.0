Keeping drivers focused on just exposing the hardware data and
functionality is likely the best path to choose, so my earlier
suggestion of a "frequency" extension would better be left for userspace
to handle.

So in order to enable userspace to derive frequency, you need reliable
timestamps for enough consecutive events to provide an adequate size
sample of data on which to perform filtering and other such operations.

If we add a COUNTER_EVENT_CHANGE_OF_STATE or similar, every count change
will generate an event with a logged timestamp. Is the problem with this
solution primarily that the Counter event queue is currently utilizing
spinlocks for synchronization?
