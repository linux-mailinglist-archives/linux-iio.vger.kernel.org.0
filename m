Absolutely. I think I spotted 2 bugs whilst just looking for places this pattern
doesn't apply.  Will circle back to those once this discussion is resolved.
I think I've taken dozen's of fixes for cases where these were missed over the years
so hoping this means I'll never see another one!

Intent just to make the allocated internal type clear?  Sure we can do that if
it helps with making it clear something is being allocated.
I can't think of a way this could be used with anything other than
a struct device_node * as the second parameter but I guess it still helps
'hint' at what is going on..

The non loop cases should be handled via the __free(device_node) as provided
by patch 1.  We'll need to keep the declaration local and initial assignment
together but that is easy enough to do and similar to the many other cleanup.h
usecases that are surfacing.
