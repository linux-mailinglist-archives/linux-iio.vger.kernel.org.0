Greetings,

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect, trust and humanity, i appeal to you to exercise a
Little patience and read through my letter i feel quite safe dealing
with you in this important business having gone through your
Remarkable profile, honestly,

 i am writing this email to you with pains, tears and sorrow from my
heart, i will really like to have well Relationship with you and I
have a special reason why I decided to contact you. I decided to
contact you due to the urgency of my situation.

My name is Miss. Esther Kipkalya, 22years old female and i am from
Kenya in East Africa. Light in complexion, single (never married)
but presently i am residing here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso refugee
camp. My Late Father Dr Kipkalya Kones was the former Kenyan road
Minister,

He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on
board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed in a
remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane crashed on
the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. You can read more about the crash

through the below site:
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html?iref=nextin,

After the burial of my father, my Father Brothers conspired and sold
my Late  father' s property to an Italian Expert rate which they
shared the , Money among themselves and live nothing for me. But My
Late father deposited the sum of $2.7Million.  in QNB Finansbank in
Turkey with my name as the next of kin,

I have contacted the bank about claiming this money and the only thing
they told me is to look for a foreign partner who will assist me in
the transfer due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso. please
I want you to Stand as my trustee,

So that I will introduce you to the Bank  as my trustee for
transferring of my father's money to your bank account in overseas. I
have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you
will not betray my trust.

But rather take me as your own biological Sister or daughter which I
will be coming to your country as soon as this money is transferred to
your account.

My dearest, things are very bad for me here in the refugee camp when I
am living today. People are dying here day after day because of lack
of food and poor medical treatment. Even one of us died last night
and was buried this morning. I am afraid of what i am seeing here. I
don't know who it will be her turn tomorrow; I was planning to read
law in my life before the ugly incident that killed my parents that
put me in this horrible place i found myself today.

This place is like a prison as we are only allowed to go out on Monday
and Friday of the week as given by the united nation rules and
regulation here in Burkina Faso. It's in this refugee we are only
allowed to go out two times in a week it's just like one staying in
the prison and i hope by God's grace I will come out here soon.

I don' t have any relatives now whom i can go to and the only person I
have now is Rev Francis Isaac who is the pastor of the (St. Peter
Church) here in the refugee,  he has been very nice to me since I came
here but i am not living with him rather i am leaving in the women's
hostel,

Because the refugee has two hostels one for men the other for women,
Please if you want to help me out of this situation respond back so
that I will tell you more about me,


Thanks
Miss. Esther Kipkalya,
