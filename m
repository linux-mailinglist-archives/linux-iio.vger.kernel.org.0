True. It's a fun corner.  We return -EBUSY in other cases where action of
some type is needed for it to free up.  We aren't implying a retry will get
you anywhere (unlikely EAGAIN).  To be honest, I'm fine with any error code
you fancy, but I think it should be an error code.

Maybe...  I get the feeling that scattering liberal comments through the
code along the lines of 'we think this is how it works' with datasheet
references might be the best we can do.

I'm confused. Why would XY be parallel to ground?  I'm struggling to get
my head around it, but I though for rotation in the x-y plane it's z that
is always parallel to the ground (or near enough that we can sensibly estim=
ate
what is going on in the xy plane)
(I spent lots of time in my youth working with the Geometric Algebra versio=
n of this
stuff where it's the XY bivector, but that's a different story and probably
not helpful here :)

I'm lost...  Best way forward here is probably for you to propose what
you think is the best we have with a lot of description and we see if that
aligns with my thoughts on how this should work (and anyone else who
cares to join in ;)

Foggy brain today I'm afraid...
