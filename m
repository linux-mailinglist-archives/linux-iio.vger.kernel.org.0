Would be interesting to look at the performance of that code, but the
real question is what channels do users typically enabled. If they enabled
a full set (and I suspect most do) then that code doesn't nothing at all.

Original thinking was that the non common case didn't really matter much.
If it is worth optimizing I'd suggest a double pass (or cheat - see later)
1st pass works out number of elements, 2nd just saves them in a nice
linear array.  It's typically small however, so maybe just allocate a linear
array big enough for the worst case.
