I must admit I got lazy, the ordering reflects the order of my
decisions and once these made, it was too painful to rebase and move
this patch earlier but I fully understand the request :) I will ping Lee
in the cover letter to ask him what is his feedback over the entire
series and if he agrees with the main idea I whish I could only respin
these three patches in the right order in v4 and request him to take v3
for all the other patches.

Thanks,
