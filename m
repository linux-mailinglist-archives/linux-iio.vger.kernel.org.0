Yep. Also, the "processed" is misleading as I implement a raw channel. I 
did originally think I'll only implement the read_raw (as I thought 
we'll need all RGBC + IR and end up doing two accesses - which wouldn't 
be nice due to the doubled measurement time). I actually did that and 
used INT_PLUS_NANO. While implementing this I noticed the 'clear' data 
was not used - and thought I might as well support buffering when RGB+IR 
are enabled. I needed the scale to get the buffered values to decent 
format though - so I converted channel to raw one and added scale. The 
commit title still contains the 'processed' which reflects the original 
thinking. Thanks for pointing out the confusion.

Thanks Jonathan. I had to give also the BU27008 sensor away for a while. 
I guess I won't send the next version until I am able to do some very 
basic testing even if the changes were minor. That's probably sometime 
next week.

I'm not really convinced the u16 is better here. We need the 32 bits 
later for the calculations - and (afaics) using natural size int for 
arguments shouldn't harm. We read the channel data to correct type array 
so code should be pretty clear as to what we have in HW.

Also, I think that having an array obfuscates what element is which 
channel because these ICs didn't have the 1 to 1 mapping from channel 
index to colour. I was thinking of adding a struct for this but decided 
to just keep it simple and clear.

So, you suggest we bring the data as u16 until here and only here we 
assign it into 32bit variables when doing the 'normalization'? I'm sure 
it works, but I dislike doing computations like multiplying u16 by u32 
as I never know (out of my head) how the implicit type conversions work 
and if we get some results cropped. Adding the casts to computation make 
it less pretty for my eyes while having all variables in large enough 
types does not leave me wondering if it works correctly and if explicit 
casts are needed.

I am not strongly opposing this though if you insist - I am sure I can 
at the end of the day get the code right - but I am afraid I will later 
look at the code and wonder if it contains hideous issues...

Sorry Jonathan. I must be a bit slow today but I just seem to not be 
able to think how you would like to have this? I think this line is 
somehow mappable to the:

IRratio = (IR > 0.18 * Green) ? 0 : 1
formula I got from HW colleagues and added in the comment preceding the 
function.
