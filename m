It's an acronym for CI system run by Intel. You should have had an email in
your mailbox with complains. It also duplicates them to a mailing list which
address I don't know by heart.

Hint, use `git grep ...` which much, much faster against the Git indexed data.

No, the new code is always should be submitted against latest release cycle,
v6.7-rcX as of today. There is the header. Please, use it.

Why no GENMASK() ? What the meaning of the 0xc0?
Ideally it should be

#define ...meaningful name...  GENMASK()

I do mind. RAII is a method to make code more robust against forgotten
unlock/free calls.

So, perhaps you need to use get_unaligned_.e32() and then FIELD_*() from
bitfield.h. This will be much better in terms of understanding the semantics
of these magic bit shifts and masks.

I understand, that's why no shame on you, just fun code to see :-)

Some maintainers suggest to use clang-format. I find it weird in some corner
cases. So, I would suggest to use it and reread the code and fix some
strangenesses.

Let's put it this way: Why do you care of the relaxed case?
I.o.w. why can we be slightly stricter?

If not yet, worse to add in the comment area of the patch
(after the cutter '---' line).

Same way with a (new) header :-)

No, what I meant is to have something like

	if (ret) {
		if (ret != -ENODEV)
			return ret;
		...regulator is not present...
	}

This is how it's being used in dozens of places in the kernel. Just utilize
`git grep ...` which should be a top-10 tool for the Linux kernel developer.

Q: ...
A: Try `git grep ...` to find your answer in the existing code.

So, fine, but the very first mandatory property check will fail as it has
the very same check inside. So, why do you need a double check?
