Comments on individual patches (in particular bad pick for that final example ;)

Given how late we are in the cycle, I'd argue we 'need' patches 2 (+ 5,6 which
should probably be all one patch to avoid introducing then fixing a warning in
different patches).  The others could wait for the following cycle if needed.

It would slow down a few patches I have queued up behind this, but most of them
would be unaffected so it wouldn't annoy me too much. Can't speak for others
however!
