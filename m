I read it wrong  :(    Thought we were iterating over the longs not the
sets of longs in each mask. oops. I read the same code further down correctly.

I blame spending whole day waiting for a plumber (who hasn't come... sigh)

It does indeed mean that!  Sorry bad habit to use idioms in discussions like
this.

Agreed - ugly for one entry so we keep those flat which means we have
to keep our eyes open for the multiple long version.

I've never come up with a sane way to do a macro to set bits
in multiple longs or seen one unfortunately.

That is probably a good idea for now.  Though we are carrying other infrastructure
to support this eventually and it feels weird to error out on it whilst we have
code to support it (assuming that terminator is long enough).
