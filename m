Sure, no problem. I'll send updated driver without obvious comments and
error messages in v3 patch series.

I've inserted such condition, because I used pm_runtime() calls inside
trig_set_state() callback, which was wrong behavior (as you correctly
mentioned before). In those situations, if userspace changed scale or freq
during a buffer reading, it was a time slot where device could go to sleep,
and this is a bad thing. Anyway, for now I'm using pm_runtime() callbacks
during buffer_enable and buffer_disable executions, so I can remove this
condition from scale/freq write operations and race will gone.

Okay, but many other drivers have such the same problem. May be it's
better to stay in the consistent state with them? What do you think?

>=20

As I understood, devm_pm_runtime_enable() executes pm_runtime_disable()
during resource utilization. I'm not sure that pm_runtime_disable()
switches off autosuspend feature. I'll take a look and remove this line
if needed.

>=20

Yes. Function pm_runtime_put_sync() transfers device to IDLE state if
needed, we do not want it here. Using pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() our
goal is for msa311 transition to SUSPEND state when driver unloading.

>=20

This dev_err() message is located here, because
pm_runtime_resume_and_get() can contain internal errors which are not
dependent on driver logic. So I try to catch such errors in this place.

>=20

Above devm action is needed to force driver to go to SUSPEND mode during
unloading. In other words, the device should be in SUSPEND mode in the two
cases:
1) When driver is loaded, but we do not have any data or configuration
requests to it (we are solving it using autosuspend feature)
2) When driver is unloaded and device is not used (devm action is used
in this case)
